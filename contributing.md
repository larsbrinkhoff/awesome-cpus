## Contibution Guidelines

Documentation for new CPUs or MCUs are happily accepted.  It's
preferred to add processor family architecture documents.  

The GitHub 1G size limit on repositories is a concern.  If a
subdirectory grows large, please add it as a git submodule.  The
submodule repository should belong to the
[awesome-cpus](https://github.com/awesome-cpus) origanization.
Everyone are welcome to join.
