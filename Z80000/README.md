The Z80000 was a 32-bit processor from Zilog which never really took off;
however it had a lot of great ideas for its time, and was in many ways superior to contemporary CPUs.
It was backward compatible with the 16-bit Z8000.

The files in this directory were acquired from an archive site (I think it was BitSavers, but I cannot be sure anymore).

A CMOS version of this processor was marketed as the Z320 as well.
