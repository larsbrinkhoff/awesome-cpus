Chapter 13  Executing 80286 Protected-Mode Code

ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ

13.1  80286 Code Executes as a Subset of the 80386

In general, programs designed for execution in protected mode on an 80286
execute without modification on the 80386, because the features of the 80286
are a subset of those of the 80386.

All the descriptors used by the 80286 are supported by the 80386 as long as
the Intel-reserved word (last word) of the 80286 descriptor is zero.

The descriptors for data segments, executable segments, local descriptor
tables, and task gates are common to both the 80286 and the 80386. Other
80286 descriptorsฤฤTSS segment, call gate, interrupt gate, and trap
gateฤฤare supported by the 80386. The 80386 also has new versions of
descriptors for TSS segment, call gate, interrupt gate, and trap gate that
support the 32-bit nature of the 80386. Both sets of descriptors can be
used simultaneously in the same system.

For those descriptors that are common to both the 80286 and the 80386, the
presence of zeros in the final word causes the 80386 to interpret these
descriptors exactly as 80286 does; for example:

Base Address      The high-order eight bits of the 32-bit base address are
                  zero, limiting base addresses to 24 bits.

Limit             The high-order four bits of the limit field are zero,
                  restricting the value of the limit field to 64K.

Granularity bit   The granularity bit is zero, which implies that the value
                  of the 16-bit limit is interpreted in units of one byte.

B-bit             In a data-segment descriptor, the B-bit is zero, implying
                  that the segment is no larger than 64 Kbytes.

D-bit             In an executable-segment descriptor, the D-bit is zero,
                  implying that 16-bit addressing and operands are the
                  default.

For formats of these descriptors and documentation of their use refer to
the iAPX 286 Programmer's Reference Manual.


13.2  Two ways to Execute 80286 Tasks

When porting 80286 programs to the 80386, there are two cases to consider:

  1.  Porting an entire 80286 system to the 80386, complete with 80286
      operating system, loader, and system builder.

      In this case, all tasks will have 80286 TSSs. The 80386 is being used
      as a faster 286.

  2.  Porting selected 80286 applications to run in an 80386 environment
      with an 80386 operating system, loader, and system builder.

      In this case, the TSSs used to represent 80286 tasks should be
      changed to 80386 TSSs. It is theoretically possible to mix 80286 and
      80386 TSSs, but the benefits are slight and the problems are great. It
      is recommended that all tasks in a 80386 software system have 80386
      TSSs. It is not necessary to change the 80286 object modules
      themselves; TSSs are usually constructed by the operating system, by
      the loader, or by the system builder. Refer to Chapter 16 for further
      discussion of the interface between 16-bit and 32-bit code.


13.3  Differences From 80286

The few differences that do exist primarily affect operating system code.


13.3.1  Wraparound of 80286 24-Bit Physical Address Space

With the 80286, any base and offset combination that addresses beyond 16M
bytes wraps around to the first megabyte of the 80286 address space. With
the 80386, since it has a greater physical address space, any such address
falls into the 17th megabyte. In the unlikely event that any software
depends on this anomaly, the same effect can be simulated on the 80386 by
using paging to map the first 64K bytes of the 17th megabyte of logical
addresses to physical addresses in the first megabyte.


13.3.2  Reserved Word of Descriptor

Because the 80386 uses the contents of the reserved word (last word) of
every descriptor, 80286 programs that place values in this word may not
execute correctly on the 80386.


13.3.3  New Descriptor Type Codes

Operating-system code that manages space in descriptor tables often uses an
invalid value in the access-rights field of descriptor-table entries to
identify unused entries. Access rights values of 80H and 00H remain invalid
for both the 80286 and 80386. Other values that were invalid on for the
80286 may be valid for the 80386 because of the additional descriptor types
defined by the 80386.


13.3.4  Restricted Semantics of LOCK

The 80286 processor implements the bus lock function differently than the
80386. Programs that use forms of memory locking specific to the 80286 may
not execute properly when transported to a specific application of the
80386.

The LOCK prefix and its corresponding output signal should only be used to
prevent other bus masters from interrupting a data movement operation.  LOCK
may only be used with the following 80386 instructions when they modify
memory. An undefined-opcode exception results from using LOCK before any
other instruction.

    Bit test and change:  BTS, BTR, BTC.
    Exchange: XCHG.
    One-operand arithmetic and logical: INC, DEC, NOT, and NEG.
    Two-operand arithmetic and logical:  ADD, ADC, SUB, SBB, AND, OR, XOR.

A locked instruction is guaranteed to lock only the area of memory defined
by the destination operand, but may lock a larger memory area.  For example,
typical 8086 and 80286 configurations lock the entire physical memory space.
With the 80386, the defined area of memory is guaranteed to be locked
against access by a processor executing a locked instruction on exactly the
same memory area, i.e., an operand with identical starting address and
identical length.


13.3.5  Additional Exceptions

The 80386 defines new exceptions that can occur even in systems designed
for the 80286.

    Exception #6 ฤฤ invalid opcode

     This exception can result from improper use of the LOCK instruction.

    Exception #14 ฤฤ page fault

     This exception may occur in an 80286 program if the operating system
     enables paging. Paging can be used in a system with 80286 tasks as long
     as all tasks use the same page directory. Because there is no place in
     an 80286 TSS to store the PDBR, switching to an 80286 task does not
     change the value of PDBR. Tasks ported from the 80286 should be given
     80386 TSSs so they can take full advantage of paging.


Chapter 14  80386 Real-Address Mode

ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ

The real-address mode of the 80386 executes object code designed for
execution on 8086, 8088, 80186, or 80188 processors, or for execution in the
real-address mode of an 80286:

In effect, the architecture of the 80386 in this mode is almost identical
to that of the 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188. To a programmer, an 80386 in
real-address mode appears as a high-speed 8086 with extensions to the
instruction set and registers. The principal features of this architecture
are defined in Chapters 2 and 3.

This chapter discusses certain additional topics that complete the system
programmer's view of the 80386 in real-address mode:

    Address formation.
    Extensions to registers and instructions.
    Interrupt and exception handling.
    Entering and leaving real-address mode.
    Real-address-mode exceptions.
    Differences from 8086.
    Differences from 80286 real-address mode.


14.1  Physical Address Formation

The 80386 provides a one Mbyte + 64 Kbyte memory space for an 8086 program.
Segment relocation is performed as in the 8086: the 16-bit value in a
segment selector is shifted left by four bits to form the base address of a
segment. The effective address is extended with four high order zeros and
added to the base to form a linear address as Figure 14-1 illustrates. (The
linear address is equivalent to the physical address, because paging is not
used in real-address mode.) Unlike the 8086, the resulting linear address
may have up to 21 significant bits. There is a possibility of a carry when
the base address is added to the effective address. On the 8086, the carried
bit is truncated, whereas on the 80386 the carried bit is stored in bit
position 20 of the linear address.

Unlike the 8086 and 80286, 32-bit effective addresses can be generated (via
the address-size prefix); however, the value of a 32-bit address may not
exceed 65535 without causing an exception. For full compatibility with 80286
real-address mode, pseudo-protection faults (interrupt 12 or 13 with no
error code) occur if an effective address is generated outside the range 0
through 65535.

14.2  Registers and Instructions

The register set available in real-address mode includes all the registers
defined for the 8086 plus the new registers introduced by the 80386: FS, GS,
debug registers, control registers, and test registers. New instructions
that explicitly operate on the segment registers FS and GS are available,
and the new segment-override prefixes can be used to cause instructions to
utilize FS and GS for address calculations. Instructions can utilize 32-bit
operands through the use of the operand size prefix.

The instruction codes that cause undefined opcode traps (interrupt 6)
include instructions of the protected mode that manipulate or interrogate
80386 selectors and descriptors; namely, VERR, VERW, LAR, LSL, LTR, STR,
LLDT, and SLDT. Programs executing in real-address mode are able to take
advantage of the new applications-oriented instructions added to the
architecture by the introduction of the 80186/80188, 80286 and 80386:

 New instructions introduced by 80186/80188 and 80286.

   ฤฤ PUSH immediate data
   ฤฤ Push all and pop all (PUSHA and POPA)
   ฤฤ Multiply immediate data
   ฤฤ Shift and rotate by immediate count
   ฤฤ String I/O
   ฤฤ ENTER and LEAVE
   ฤฤ BOUND

 New instructions introduced by 80386.

   ฤฤ LSS, LFS, LGS instructions
   ฤฤ Long-displacement conditional jumps
   ฤฤ Single-bit instructions
   ฤฤ Bit scan
   ฤฤ Double-shift instructions
   ฤฤ Byte set on condition
   ฤฤ Move with sign/zero extension
   ฤฤ Generalized multiply
   ฤฤ MOV to and from control registers
   ฤฤ MOV to and from test registers
   ฤฤ MOV to and from debug registers


14.3  Interrupt and Exception Handling

Interrupts and exceptions in 80386 real-address mode work as much as they
do on an 8086. Interrupts and exceptions vector to interrupt procedures via
an interrupt table. The processor multiplies the interrupt or exception
identifier by four to obtain an index into the interrupt table. The entries
of the interrupt table are far pointers to the entry points of interrupt or
exception handler procedures. When an interrupt occurs, the processor
pushes the current values of CS:IP onto the stack, disables interrupts,
clears TF (the single-step flag), then transfers control to the location
specified in the interrupt table. An IRET instruction at the end of the
handler procedure reverses these steps before returning control to the
interrupted procedure.

The primary difference in the interrupt handling of the 80386 compared to
the 8086 is that the location and size of the interrupt table depend on the
contents of the IDTR (IDT register). Ordinarily, this fact is not apparent
to programmers, because, after RESET, the IDTR contains a base address of 0
and a limit of 3FFH, which is compatible with the 8086. However, the LIDT
instruction can be used in real-address mode to change the base and limit
values in the IDTR. Refer to Chapter 9 for details on the IDTR, and the
LIDT and SIDT instructions. If an interrupt occurs and the corresponding
entry of the interrupt table is beyond the limit stored in the IDTR, the
processor raises exception 8.


14.4  Entering and Leaving Real-Address Mode

Real-address mode is in effect after a signal on the RESET pin. Even if the
system is going to be used in protected mode, the start-up program will
execute in real-address mode temporarily while initializing for protected
mode.


14.4.1  Switching to Protected Mode

The only way to leave real-address mode is to switch to protected mode. The
processor enters protected mode when a MOV to CR0 instruction sets the PE
(protection enable) bit in CR0. (For compatibility with the 80286, the LMSW
instruction may also be used to set the PE bit.)

Refer to Chapter 10 "Initialization" for other aspects of switching to
protected mode.


14.5  Switching Back to Real-Address Mode

The processor reenters real-address mode if software clears the PE bit in
CR0 with a MOV to CR0 instruction. A procedure that attempts to do this,
however, should proceed as follows:

  1.  If paging is enabled, perform the following sequence:

        Transfer control to linear addresses that have an identity mapping;
         i.e., linear addresses equal physical addresses.

        Clear the PG bit in CR0.

        Move zeros to CR3 to clear out the paging cache.

  2.  Transfer control to a segment that has a limit of 64K (FFFFH). This
      loads the CS register with the limit it needs to have in real mode.

  3.  Load segment registers SS, DS, ES, FS, and GS with a selector that
      points to a descriptor containing the following values, which are
      appropriate to real mode:

        Limit = 64K   (FFFFH)
        Byte granular (G = 0)
        Expand up     (E = 0)
        Writable      (W = 1)
        Present       (P = 1)
        Base = any value

  4.  Disable interrupts. A CLI instruction disables INTR interrupts. NMIs
      can be disabled with external circuitry.

  5.  Clear the PE bit.

  6.  Jump to the real mode code to be executed using a far JMP. This
      action flushes the instruction queue and puts appropriate values in
      the access rights of the CS register.

  7.  Use the LIDT instruction to load the base and limit of the real-mode
      interrupt vector table.

  8.  Enable interrupts.

  9.  Load the segment registers as needed by the real-mode code.


14.6  Real-Address Mode Exceptions

The 80386 reports some exceptions differently when executing in
real-address mode than when executing in protected mode. Table 14-1 details
the real-address-mode exceptions.


14.7  Differences From 8086

In general, the 80386 in real-address mode will correctly execute ROM-based
software designed for the 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188. Following is a list
of the minor differences between 8086 execution on the 80386 and on an 8086.

  1.  Instruction clock counts.

      The 80386 takes fewer clocks for most instructions than the 8086/8088.
      The areas most likely to be affected are:

        Delays required by I/O devices between I/O operations.

        Assumed delays with 8086/8088 operating in parallel with an 8087.

  2.  Divide Exceptions Point to the DIV instruction.

      Divide exceptions on the 80386 always leave the saved CS:IP value
      pointing to the instruction that failed. On the 8086/8088, the CS:IP
      value points to the next instruction.

  3.  Undefined 8086/8088 opcodes.

      Opcodes that were not defined for the 8086/8088 will cause exception
      6 or will execute one of the new instructions defined for the 80386.

  4.  Value written by PUSH SP.

      The 80386 pushes a different value on the stack for PUSH SP than the
      8086/8088. The 80386 pushes the value of SP before SP is incremented
      as part of the push operation; the 8086/8088 pushes the value of SP
      after it is incremented. If the value pushed is important, replace
      PUSH SP instructions with the following three instructions:

      PUSH  BP
      MOV   BP, SP
      XCHG  BP, [BP]

      This code functions as the 8086/8088 PUSH SP instruction on the 80386.

  5.  Shift or rotate by more than 31 bits.

      The 80386 masks all shift and rotate counts to the low-order five
      bits. This MOD 32 operation limits the count to a maximum of 31 bits,
      thereby limiting the time that interrupt response is delayed while
      the instruction is executing.

  6.  Redundant prefixes.

      The 80386 sets a limit of 15 bytes on instruction length. The only
      way to violate this limit is by putting redundant prefixes before an
      instruction. Exception 13 occurs if the limit on instruction length
      is violated. The 8086/8088 has no instruction length limit.

  7.  Operand crossing offset 0 or 65,535.

      On the 8086, an attempt to access a memory operand that crosses
      offset 65,535 (e.g., MOV a word to offset 65,535) or offset 0 (e.g.,
      PUSH a word when SP = 1) causes the offset to wrap around modulo
      65,536. The 80386 raises an exception in these casesฤฤexception 13 if
      the segment is a data segment (i.e., if CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS is being
      used to address the segment), exception 12 if the segment is a stack
      segment (i.e., if SS is being used).

  8.  Sequential execution across offset 65,535.

      On the 8086, if sequential execution of instructions proceeds past
      offset 65,535, the processor fetches the next instruction byte from
      offset 0 of the same segment. On the 80386, the processor raises
      exception 13 in such a case.

  9.  LOCK is restricted to certain instructions.

      The LOCK prefix and its corresponding output signal should only be
      used to prevent other bus masters from interrupting a data movement
      operation. The 80386 always asserts the LOCK signal during an XCHG
      instruction with memory (even if the LOCK prefix is not used). LOCK
      may only be used with the following 80386 instructions when they
      update memory: BTS, BTR, BTC, XCHG, ADD, ADC, SUB, SBB, INC, DEC,
      AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and NEG. An undefined-opcode exception
      (interrupt 6) results from using LOCK before any other instruction.

 10.  Single-stepping external interrupt handlers.

      The priority of the 80386 single-step exception is different from that
      of the 8086/8088. The change prevents an external interrupt handler
      from being single-stepped if the interrupt occurs while a program is
      being single-stepped. The 80386 single-step exception has higher
      priority that any external interrupt. The 80386 will still single-step
      through an interrupt handler invoked by the INT instructions or by an
      exception.

 11.  IDIV exceptions for quotients of 80H or 8000H.

      The 80386 can generate the largest negative number as a quotient for
      the IDIV instruction. The 8086/8088 causes exception zero instead.

 12.  Flags in stack.

      The setting of the flags stored by PUSHF, by interrupts, and by
      exceptions is different from that stored by the 8086 in bit positions
      12 through 15. On the 8086 these bits are stored as ones, but in
      80386 real-address mode bit 15 is always zero, and bits 14 through 12
      reflect the last value loaded into them.

 13.  NMI interrupting NMI handlers.

      After an NMI is recognized on the 80386, the NMI interrupt is masked
      until an IRET instruction is executed.

 14.  Coprocessor errors vector to interrupt 16.

      Any 80386 system with a coprocessor must use interrupt vector 16 for
      the coprocessor error exception. If an 8086/8088 system uses another
      vector for the 8087 interrupt, both vectors should point to the
      coprocessor-error exception handler.

 15.  Numeric exception handlers should allow prefixes.

      On the 80386, the value of CS:IP saved for coprocessor exceptions
      points at any prefixes before an ESC instruction. On 8086/8088
      systems, the saved CS:IP points to the ESC instruction.

 16.  Coprocessor does not use interrupt controller.

      The coprocessor error signal to the 80386 does not pass through an
      interrupt controller (an 8087 INT signal does). Some instructions in
      a coprocessor error handler may need to be deleted if they deal with
      the interrupt controller.

 17.  Six new interrupt vectors.

      The 80386 adds six exceptions that arise only if the 8086 program has
      a hidden bug. It is recommended that exception handlers be added that
      treat these exceptions as invalid operations. This additional
      software does not significantly affect the existing 8086 software
      because the interrupts do not normally occur. These interrupt
      identifiers should not already have been used by the 8086 software,
      because they are in the range reserved by Intel. Table 14-2 describes
      the new 80386 exceptions.

 18.  One megabyte wraparound.

      The 80386 does not wrap addresses at 1 megabyte in real-address mode.
      On members of the 8086 family, it possible to specify addresses
      greater than one megabyte.  For example, with a selector value 0FFFFH
      and an offset of 0FFFFH, the effective address would be 10FFEFH (1
      Mbyte + 65519).  The 8086, which can form adresses only up to 20 bits
      long, truncates the high-order bit, thereby "wrapping" this address
      to 0FFEFH.  However, the 80386, which can form addresses up to 32
      bits long does not truncate such an address.

    5       A BOUND instruction was executed with a register value outside
            the limit values.

    6       An undefined opcode was encountered or LOCK was used improperly
            before an instruction to which it does not apply.

    7       The EM bit in the MSW is set when an ESC instruction was
            encountered. This exception also occurs on a WAIT instruction
            if TS is set.

    8       An exception or interrupt has vectored to an interrupt table
            entry beyond the interrupt table limit in IDTR. This can occur
            only if the LIDT instruction has changed the limit from the
            default value of 3FFH, which is enough for all 256 interrupt
            IDs.

   12       Operand crosses extremes of stack segment, e.g., MOV operation

   13       Operand crosses extremes of a segment other than a stack
            segment; or sequential instruction execution attempts to
            proceed beyond offset 0FFFFH; or an instruction is longer than
            15 bytes (including prefixes).


14.8  Differences From 80286 Real-Address Mode

The few differences that exist between 80386 real-address mode and 80286
real-address mode are not likely to affect any existing 80286 programs
except possibly the system initialization procedures.


14.8.1  Bus Lock

The 80286 processor implements the bus lock function differently than the
80386. Programs that use forms of memory locking specific to the 80286 may
not execute properly if transported to a specific application of the 80386.

The LOCK prefix and its corresponding output signal should only be used to
prevent other bus masters from interrupting a data movement operation.  LOCK
may only be used with the following 80386 instructions when they modify
memory.  An undefined-opcode exception results from using LOCK before any
other instruction.

    Bit test and change:  BTS, BTR, BTC.
    Exchange: XCHG.
    One-operand arithmetic and logical: INC, DEC, NOT, and NEG.
    Two-operand arithmetic and logical: ADD, ADC, SUB, SBB, AND, OR, XOR.

A locked instruction is guaranteed to lock only the area of memory defined
by the destination operand, but may lock a larger memory area.  For example,
typical 8086 and 80286 configurations lock the entire physical memory space.
With the 80386, the defined area of memory is guranteed to be locked against
access by a processor executing a locked instruction on exactly the same
memory area, i.e., an operand with identical starting address and identical
length.


14.8.2  Location of First Instruction

The starting location is 0FFFFFFF0H (sixteen bytes from end of 32-bit
address space) on the 80386 rather than 0FFFFF0H (sixteen bytes from end of
24-bit address space) as on the 80286.  Many 80286 ROM initialization
programs will work correctly in this new environment.  Others can be made to
work correctly with external hardware that redefines the signals on
A{31-20}.


14.8.3  Initial Values of General Registers

On the 80386, certain general registers may contain different values after
RESET than on the 80286. This should not cause compatibility problems,
because the content of 8086 registers after RESET is undefined.  If
self-test is requested during the reset sequence and errors are detected in
the 80386 unit, EAX will contain a nonzero value. EDX contains the component
and revision identifier. Refer to Chapter 10 for more information.


14.8.4  MSW Initialization

The 80286 initializes the MSW register to FFF0H, but the 80386 initializes
this register to 0000H. This difference should have no effect, because the
bits that are different are undefined on the 80286.  Programs that read the
value of the MSW will behave differently on the 80386 only if they depend on
the setting of the undefined, high-order bits.

The 80386 supports execution of one or more 8086, 8088, 80186, or 80188
programs in an 80386 protected-mode environment. An 8086 program runs in
this environment as part of a V86 (virtual 8086) task. V86 tasks take
advantage of the hardware support of multitasking offered by the protected
mode. Not only can there be multiple V86 tasks, each one executing an 8086
program, but V86 tasks can be multiprogrammed with other 80386 tasks.

The purpose of a V86 task is to form a "virtual machine" with which to
execute an 8086 program. A complete virtual machine consists not only of
80386 hardware but also of systems software. Thus, the emulation of an 8086
is the result of cooperation between hardware and software:

    The hardware provides a virtual set of registers (via the TSS), a
     virtual memory space (the first megabyte of the linear address space of
     the task), and directly executes all instructions that deal with these
     registers and with this address space.

    The software controls the external interfaces of the virtual machine
     (I/O, interrupts, and exceptions) in a manner consistent with the
     larger environment in which it executes. In the case of I/O, software
     can choose either to emulate I/O instructions or to let the hardware
     execute them directly without software intervention.

Software that helps implement virtual 8086 machines is called a V86
monitor.


15.1  Executing 8086 Code

The processor executes in V86 mode when the VM (virtual machine) bit in the
EFLAGS register is set. The processor tests this flag under two general
conditions:

  1.  When loading segment registers to know whether to use 8086-style
      address formation.

  2.  When decoding instructions to determine which instructions are
      sensitive to IOPL.

Except for these two modifications to its normal operations, the 80386 in
V86 mode operated much as in protected mode.


15.1.1  Registers and Instructions

The register set available in V86 mode includes all the registers defined
for the 8086 plus the new registers introduced by the 80386: FS, GS, debug
registers, control registers, and test registers. New instructions that
explicitly operate on the segment registers FS and GS are available, and the
new segment-override prefixes can be used to cause instructions to utilize
FS and GS for address calculations. Instructions can utilize 32-bit
operands through the use of the operand size prefix.

8086 programs running as V86 tasks are able to take advantage of the new
applications-oriented instructions added to the architecture by the
introduction of the 80186/80188, 80286 and 80386:

    New instructions introduced by 80186/80188 and 80286.
     ฤฤ PUSH immediate data
     ฤฤ Push all and pop all (PUSHA and POPA)
     ฤฤ Multiply immediate data
     ฤฤ Shift and rotate by immediate count
     ฤฤ String I/O
     ฤฤ ENTER and LEAVE
     ฤฤ BOUND

    New instructions introduced by 80386.
     ฤฤ LSS, LFS, LGS instructions
     ฤฤ Long-displacement conditional jumps
     ฤฤ Single-bit instructions
     ฤฤ Bit scan
     ฤฤ Double-shift instructions
     ฤฤ Byte set on condition
     ฤฤ Move with sign/zero extension
     ฤฤ Generalized multiply


15.1.2  Linear Address Formation

In V86 mode, the 80386 processor does not interpret 8086 selectors by
referring to descriptors; instead, it forms linear addresses as an 8086
would. It shifts the selector left by four bits to form a 20-bit base
address. The effective address is extended with four high-order zeros and
added to the base address to create a linear address as Figure 15-1
illustrates.

Because of the possibility of a carry, the resulting linear address may
contain up to 21 significant bits. An 8086 program may generate linear
addresses anywhere in the range 0 to 10FFEFH (one megabyte plus
approximately 64 Kbytes) of the task's linear address space.

V86 tasks generate 32-bit linear addresses. While an 8086 program can only
utilize the low-order 21 bits of a linear address, the linear address can be
mapped via page tables to any 32-bit physical address.

Unlike the 8086 and 80286, 32-bit effective addresses can be generated (via
the address-size prefix); however, the value of a 32-bit address may not
exceed 65,535 without causing an exception. For full compatibility with
80286 real-address mode, pseudo-protection faults (interrupt 12 or 13 with
no error code) occur if an address is generated outside the range 0 through
65,535.

15.2  Structure of a V86 Task

A V86 task consists partly of the 8086 program to be executed and partly of
80386 "native mode" code that serves as the virtual-machine monitor. The
task must be represented by an 80386 TSS (not an 80286 TSS). The processor
enters V86 mode to execute the 8086 program and returns to protected mode to
execute the monitor or other 80386 tasks.

To run successfully in V86 mode, an existing 8086 program needs the
following:

    A V86 monitor.
    Operating-system services.

The V86 monitor is 80386 protected-mode code that executes at
privilege-level zero. The monitor consists primarily of initialization and
exception-handling procedures. As for any other 80386 program,
executable-segment descriptors for the monitor must exist in the GDT or in
the task's LDT. The linear addresses above 10FFEFH are available for the
V86 monitor, the operating system, and other systems software. The monitor
may also need data-segment descriptors so that it can examine the interrupt
vector table or other parts of the 8086 program in the first megabyte of the
address space.

In general, there are two options for implementing the 8086 operating
system:

  1.  The 8086 operating system may run as part of the 8086 code. This
      approach is desirable for any of the following reasons:

        The 8086 applications code modifies the operating system.

        There is not sufficient development time to reimplement the 8086
         operating system as 80386 code.

  2.  The 8086 operating system may be implemented or emulated in the V86
      monitor. This approach is desirable for any of the following reasons:

        Operating system functions can be more easily coordinated among
         several V86 tasks.

        The functions of the 8086 operating system can be easily emulated
         by calls to the 80386 operating system.

Note that, regardless of the approach chosen for implementing the 8086
operating system, different V86 tasks may use different 8086 operating
systems.


15.2.1  Using Paging for V86 Tasks

Paging is not necessary for a single V86 task, but paging is useful or
necessary for any of the following reasons:

    To create multiple V86 tasks. Each task must map the lower megabyte of
     linear addresses to different physical locations.

    To emulate the megabyte wrap. On members of the 8086 family, it is
     possible to specify addresses larger than one megabyte. For example,
     with a selector value of 0FFFFH and an offset of 0FFFFH, the effective
     address would be 10FFEFH (one megabyte + 65519). The 8086, which can
     form addresses only up to 20 bits long, truncates the high-order bit,
     thereby "wrapping" this address to 0FFEFH. The 80386, however, which
     can form addresses up to 32 bits long does not truncate such an
     address. If any 8086 programs depend on this addressing anomaly, the
     same effect can be achieved in a V86 task by mapping linear addresses
     between 100000H and 110000H and linear addresses between 0 and 10000H
     to the same physical addresses.

    To create a virtual address space larger than the physical address
     space.

    To share 8086 OS code or ROM code that is common to several 8086
     programs that are executing simultaneously.

    To redirect or trap references to memory-mapped I/O devices.


15.2.2  Protection within a V86 Task

Because it does not refer to descriptors while executing 8086 programs, the
processor also does not utilize the protection mechanisms offered by
descriptors. To protect the systems software that runs in a V86 task from
the 8086 program, software designers may follow either of these approaches:

    Reserve the first megabyte (plus 64 kilobytes) of each task's linear
     address space for the 8086 program. An 8086 task cannot generate
     addresses outside this range.

    Use the U/S bit of page-table entries to protect the virtual-machine
     monitor and other systems software in each virtual 8086 task's space.
     When the processor is in V86 mode, CPL is 3. Therefore, an 8086 program
     has only user privileges. If the pages of the virtual-machine monitor
     have supervisor privilege, they cannot be accessed by the 8086 program.


15.3  Entering and Leaving V86 Mode

Figure 15-2 summarizes the ways that the processor can enter and leave an
8086 program. The processor can enter V86 by either of two means:

  1.  A task switch to an 80386 task loads the image of EFLAGS from the new
      TSS. The TSS of the new task must be an 80386 TSS, not an 80286 TSS,
      because the 80286 TSS does not store the high-order word of EFLAGS,
      which contains the VM flag. A value of one in the VM bit of the new
      EFLAGS indicates that the new task is executing 8086 instructions;
      therefore, while loading the segment registers from the TSS, the
      processor forms base addresses as the 8086 would.

  2.  An IRET from a procedure of an 80386 task loads the image of EFLAGS
      from the stack. A value of one in VM in this case indicates that the
      procedure to which control is being returned is an 8086 procedure. The
      CPL at the time the IRET is executed must be zero, else the processor
      does not change VM.

The processor leaves V86 mode when an interrupt or exception occurs. There
are two cases:

  1.  The interrupt or exception causes a task switch. A task switch from a
      V86 task to any other task loads EFLAGS from the TSS of the new task.
      If the new TSS is an 80386 TSS and the VM bit in the EFLAGS image is
      zero or if the new TSS is an 80286 TSS, then the processor clears the
      VM bit of EFLAGS, loads the segment registers from the new TSS using
      80386-style address formation, and begins executing the instructions
      of the new task according to 80386 protected-mode semantics.

  2.  The interrupt or exception vectors to a privilege-level zero
      procedure. The processor stores the current setting of EFLAGS on the
      stack, then clears the VM bit. The interrupt or exception handler,
      therefore, executes as "native" 80386 protected-mode code. If an
      interrupt or exception vectors to a conforming segment or to a
      privilege level other than three, the processor causes a
      general-protection exception; the error code is the selector of the
      executable segment to which transfer was attempted.

Systems software does not manipulate the VM flag directly, but rather
manipulates the image of the EFLAGS register that is stored on the stack or
in the TSS. The V86 monitor sets the VM flag in the EFLAGS image on the
stack or in the TSS when first creating a V86 task. Exception and interrupt
handlers can examine the VM flag on the stack. If the interrupted procedure
was executing in V86 mode, the handler may need to invoke the V86 monitor.

15.3.1  Transitions Through Task Switches

A task switch to or from a V86 task may be due to any of three causes:

  1.  An interrupt that vectors to a task gate.
  2.  An action of the scheduler of the 80386 operating system.
  3.  An IRET when the NT flag is set.

In any of these cases, the processor changes the VM bit in EFLAGS according
to the image of EFLAGS in the new TSS. If the new TSS is an 80286 TSS, the
high-order word of EFLAGS is not in the TSS; the processor clears VM in this
case. The processor updates VM prior to loading the segment registers from
the images in the new TSS. The new setting of VM determines whether the
processor interprets the new segment-register images as 8086 selectors or
80386/80286 selectors.


15.3.2  Transitions Through Trap Gates and Interrupt Gates

The processor leaves V86 mode as the result of an exception or interrupt
that vectors via a trap or interrupt gate to a privilege-level zero
procedure. The exception or interrupt handler returns to the 8086 code by
executing an IRET.

Because it was designed for execution by an 8086 processor, an 8086 program
in a V86 task will have an 8086-style interrupt table starting at linear
address zero. However, the 80386 does not use this table directly. For all
exceptions and interrupts that occur in V86 mode, the processor vectors
through the IDT. The IDT entry for an interrupt or exception that occurs in
a V86 task must contain either:

    A task gate.

    An 80386 trap gate (type 14) or an 80386 interrupt gate (type 15),
     which must point to a nonconforming, privilege-level zero, code
     segment.

Interrupts and exceptions that have 80386 trap or interrupt gates in the
IDT vector to the appropriate handler procedure at privilege-level zero. The
contents of all the 8086 segment registers are stored on the PL 0 stack.
Figure 15-3 shows the format of the PL 0 stack after an exception or
interrupt that occurs while a V86 task is executing an 8086 program.

After the processor stores all the 8086 segment registers on the PL 0
stack, it loads all the segment registers with zeros before starting to
execute the handler procedure. This permits the interrupt handler to safely
save and restore the DS, ES, FS, and GS registers as 80386 selectors.
Interrupt handlers that may be invoked in the context of either a regular
task or a V86 task, can use the same prolog and epilog code for register
saving regardless of the kind of task. Restoring zeros to these registers
before execution of the IRET does not cause a trap in the interrupt handler.
Interrupt procedures that expect values in the segment registers or that
return values via segment registers have to use the register images stored
on the PL 0 stack. Interrupt handlers that need to know whether the
interrupt occurred in V86 mode can examine the VM bit in the stored EFLAGS
image.

An interrupt handler passes control to the V86 monitor if the VM bit is set
in the EFLAGS image stored on the stack and the interrupt or exception is
one that the monitor needs to handle. The V86 monitor may either:

    Handle the interrupt completely within the V86 monitor.
    Invoke the 8086 program's interrupt handler.

Reflecting an interrupt or exception back to the 8086 code involves the
following steps:

  1.  Refer to the 8086 interrupt vector to locate the appropriate handler
      procedure.

  2.  Store the state of the 8086 program on the privilege-level three
      stack.

  3.  Change the return link on the privilege-level zero stack to point to
      the privilege-level three handler procedure.

  4.  Execute an IRET so as to pass control to the handler.

  5.  When the IRET by the privilege-level three handler again traps to the
      V86 monitor, restore the return link on the privilege-level zero stack
      to point to the originally interrupted, privilege-level three
      procedure.

  6.  Execute an IRET so as to pass control back to the interrupted
      procedure.

15.4  Additional Sensitive Instructions

When the 80386 is executing in V86 mode, the instructions PUSHF, POPF,
INT n, and IRET are sensitive to IOPL. The instructions IN, INS, OUT, and
OUTS, which are ordinarily sensitive in protected mode, are not sensitive
in V86 mode. Following is a complete list of instructions that are sensitive
in V86 mode:

   CLI     ฤฤ Clear Interrupt-Enable Flag
   STI     ฤฤ Set Interrupt-Enable Flag
   LOCK    ฤฤ Assert Bus-Lock Signal
   PUSHF   ฤฤ Push Flags
   POPF    ฤฤ Pop Flags
   INT n   ฤฤ Software Interrupt
   RET     ฤฤ Interrupt Return

CPL is always three in V86 mode; therefore, if IOPL < 3, these instructions
will trigger a general-protection exceptions. These instructions are made
sensitive so that their functions can be simulated by the V86 monitor.


15.4.1  Emulating 8086 Operating System Calls

INT n is sensitive so that the V86 monitor can intercept calls to the
8086 OS. Many 8086 operating systems are called by pushing parameters onto
the stack, then executing an INT n instruction. If IOPL < 3, INT n
instructions will be intercepted by the V86 monitor. The V86 monitor can
then emulate the function of the 8086 operating system or reflect the
interrupt back to the 8086 operating system in V86 mode.


15.4.2  Virtualizing the Interrupt-Enable Flag

When the processor is executing 8086 code in a V86 task, the instructions
PUSHF, POPF, and IRET are sensitive to IOPL so that the V86 monitor can
control changes to the interrupt-enable flag (IF). Other instructions that
affect IF (STI and CLI) are IOPL sensitive both in 8086 code and in
80386/80386 code.

Many 8086 programs that were designed to execute on single-task systems set
and clear IF to control interrupts. However, when these same programs are
executed in a multitasking environment, such control of IF can be
disruptive. If IOPL is less than three, all instructions that change or
interrogate IF will trap to the V86 monitor. The V86 monitor can then
control IF in a manner that both suits the needs of the larger environment
and is transparent to the 8086 program.


15.5  Virtual I/O

Many 8086 programs that were designed to execute on single-task systems use
I/O devices directly. However, when these same programs are executed in a
multitasking environment, such use of devices can be disruptive. The 80386
provides sufficient flexibility to control I/O in a manner that both suits
the needs of the new environment and is transparent to the 8086 program.
Designers may take any of several possible approaches to controlling I/O:

    Implement or emulate the 8086 operating system as an 80386 program and
     require the 8086 application to do I/O via software interrupts to the
     operating system, trapping all attempts to do I/O directly.

    Let the 8086 program take complete control of all I/O.

    Selectively trap and emulate references that a task makes to specific
     I/O ports.

    Trap or redirect references to memory-mapped I/O addresses.

The method of controlling I/O depends upon whether I/O ports are I/O mapped
or memory mapped.


15.5.1  I/O-Mapped I/O

I/O-mapped I/O in V86 mode differs from protected mode only in that the
protection mechanism does not consult IOPL when executing the I/O
instructions IN, INS, OUT, OUTS. Only the I/O permission bit map controls
the right for V86 tasks to execute these I/O instructions.

The I/O permission map traps I/O instructions selectively depending on the
I/O addresses to which they refer. The I/O permission bit map of each V86
task determines which I/O addresses are trapped for that task. Because each
task may have a different I/O permission bit map, the addresses trapped for
one task may be different from those trapped for others. Refer to Chapter 8
for more information about the I/O permission map.


15.5.2  Memory-Mapped I/O

In hardware designs that utilize memory-mapped I/O, the paging facilities
of the 80386 can be used to trap or redirect I/O operations. Each task that
executes memory-mapped I/O must have a page (or pages) for the memory-mapped
address space. The V86 monitor may control memory-mapped I/O by any of
these means:

    Assign the memory-mapped page to appropriate physical addresses.
     Different tasks may have different physical addresses, thereby
     preventing the tasks from interfering with each other.

    Cause a trap to the monitor by forcing a page fault on the
     memory-mapped page. Read-only pages trap writes. Not-present pages trap
     both reads and writes.

Intervention for every I/O might be excessive for some kinds of I/O
devices. A page fault can still be used in this case to cause intervention
on the first I/O operation. The monitor can then at least make sure that the
task has exclusive access to the device. Then the monitor can change the
page status to present and read/write, allowing subsequent I/O to proceed at
full speed.


15.5.3  Special I/O Buffers

Buffers of intelligent controllers (for example, a bit-mapped graphics
buffer) can also be virtualized via page mapping. The linear space for the
buffer can be mapped to a different physical space for each virtual 8086
task. The V86 monitor can then assume responsibility for spooling the data
or assigning the virtual buffer to the real buffer at appropriate times.


15.6  Differences From 8086

In general, V86 mode will correctly execute software designed for the 8086,
8088, 80186, and 80188. Following is a list of the minor differences between
8086 execution on the 80386 and on an 8086.

  1.  Instruction clock counts.

      The 80386 takes fewer clocks for most instructions than the 
      8086/8088. The areas most likely to be affected are:

        Delays required by I/O devices between I/O operations.

        Assumed delays with 8086/8088 operating in parallel with an 8087.

  2.  Divide exceptions point to the DIV instruction.

      Divide exceptions on the 80386 always leave the saved CS:IP value
      pointing to the instruction that failed. On the 8086/8088, the CS:IP
      value points to the next instruction.

  3.  Undefined 8086/8088 opcodes.

      Opcodes that were not defined for the 8086/8088 will cause exception
      6 or will execute one of the new instructions defined for the 80386.

  4.  Value written by PUSH SP.

      The 80386 pushes a different value on the stack for PUSH SP than the
      8086/8088. The 80386 pushes the value of SP before SP is incremented
      as part of the push operation; the 8086/8088 pushes the value of SP
      after it is incremented. If the value pushed is important, replace
      PUSH SP instructions with the following three instructions:

      PUSH  BP
      MOV   BP, SP
      XCHG  BP, [BP]

      This code functions as the 8086/8088 PUSH SP instruction on the 
      80386.

  5.  Shift or rotate by more than 31 bits.

      The 80386 masks all shift and rotate counts to the low-order five
      bits. This MOD 32 operation limits the count to a maximum of 31 bits,
      thereby limiting the time that interrupt response is delayed while
      the instruction is executing.

  6.  Redundant prefixes.

      The 80386 sets a limit of 15 bytes on instruction length. The only
      way to violate this limit is by putting redundant prefixes before an
      instruction. Exception 13 occurs if the limit on instruction length
      is violated. The 8086/8088 has no instruction length limit.

  7.  Operand crossing offset 0 or 65,535.

      On the 8086, an attempt to access a memory operand that crosses
      offset 65,535 (e.g., MOV a word to offset 65,535) or offset 0 (e.g.,
      PUSH a word when SP = 1) causes the offset to wrap around modulo
      65,536. The 80386 raises an exception in these casesฤฤexception 13 if
      the segment is a data segment (i.e., if CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS is
      being used to address the segment), exception 12 if the segment is a
      stack segment (i.e., if SS is being used).

  8.  Sequential execution across offset 65,535.

      On the 8086, if sequential execution of instructions proceeds past
      offset 65,535, the processor fetches the next instruction byte from
      offset 0 of the same segment. On the 80386, the processor raises
      exception 13 in such a case.

  9.  LOCK is restricted to certain instructions.

      The LOCK prefix and its corresponding output signal should only be
      used to prevent other bus masters from interrupting a data movement
      operation. The 80386 always asserts the LOCK signal during an XCHG
      instruction with memory (even if the LOCK prefix is not used). LOCK
      may only be used with the following 80386 instructions when they
      update memory: BTS, BTR, BTC, XCHG, ADD, ADC, SUB, SBB, INC, DEC,
      AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and NEG. An undefined-opcode exception (interrupt
      6) results from using LOCK before any other instruction.

 10.  Single-stepping external interrupt handlers.

      The priority of the 80386 single-step exception is different from
      that of the 8086/8088. The change prevents an external interrupt
      handler from being single-stepped if the interrupt occurs while a
      program is being single-stepped. The 80386 single-step exception has
      higher priority that any external interrupt. The 80386 will still
      single-step through an interrupt handler invoked by the INT
      instructions or by an exception.

  11.  IDIV exceptions for quotients of 80H or 8000H.

      The 80386 can generate the largest negative number as a quotient for
      the IDIV instruction. The 8086/8088 causes exception zero instead.

 12.  Flags in stack.

      The setting of the flags stored by PUSHF, by interrupts, and by
      exceptions is different from that stored by the 8086 in bit positions
      12 through 15. On the 8086 these bits are stored as ones, but in V86
      mode bit 15 is always zero, and bits 14 through 12 reflect the last
      value loaded into them.

 13.  NMI interrupting NMI handlers.

      After an NMI is recognized on the 80386, the NMI interrupt is masked
      until an IRET instruction is executed.

 14.  Coprocessor errors vector to interrupt 16.

      Any 80386 system with a coprocessor must use interrupt vector 16 for
      the coprocessor error exception. If an 8086/8088 system uses another
      vector for the 8087 interrupt, both vectors should point to the
      coprocessor-error exception handler.

 15.  Numeric exception handlers should allow prefixes.

      On the 80386, the value of CS:IP saved for coprocessor exceptions
      points at any prefixes before an ESC instruction. On 8086/8088
      systems, the saved CS:IP points to the ESC instruction itself.

 16.  Coprocessor does not use interrupt controller.

      The coprocessor error signal to the 80386 does not pass through an
      interrupt controller (an 8087 INT signal does). Some instructions in
      a coprocessor error handler may need to be deleted if they deal with
      the interrupt controller.


15.7  Differences From 80286 Real-Address Mode

The 80286 processor implements the bus lock function differently than the
80386. This fact may or may not be apparent to 8086 programs, depending on
how the V86 monitor handles the LOCK prefix. LOCKed instructions are
sensitive to IOPL; therefore, software designers can choose to emulate its
function. If, however, 8086 programs are allowed to execute LOCK directly,
programs that use forms of memory locking specific to the 8086 may not
execute properly when transported to a specific application of the 80386.

The LOCK prefix and its corresponding output signal should only be used to
prevent other bus masters from interrupting a data movement operation. LOCK
may only be used with the following 80386 instructions when they modify
memory. An undefined-opcode exception results from using LOCK before any
other instruction.

    Bit test and change: BTS, BTR, BTC.
    Exchange: XCHG.
    One-operand arithmetic and logical: INC, DEC, NOT, and NEG.
    Two-operand arithmetic and logical: ADD, ADC, SUB, SBB, AND, OR, XOR.

A locked instruction is guaranteed to lock only the area of memory defined
by the destination operand, but may lock a larger memory area. For example,
typical 8086 and 80286 configurations lock the entire physical memory space.
With the 80386, the defined area of memory is guaranteed to be locked
against access by a processor executing a locked instruction on exactly the
same memory area, i.e., an operand with identical starting address and
identical length.


Chapter 16  Mixing 16-Bit and 32 Bit Code

ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ

The 80386 running in protected mode is a 32-bit microprocessor, but it is
designed to support 16-bit processing at three levels:

  1.  Executing 8086/80286 16-bit programs efficiently with complete 
      compatibility.

  2.  Mixing 16-bit modules with 32-bit modules.

  3.  Mixing 16-bit and 32-bit addresses and operands within one module.

The first level of support for 16-bit programs has already been discussed
in Chapter 13, Chapter 14, and Chapter 15. This chapter shows how 16-bit
and 32-bit modules can cooperate with one another, and how one module can
utilize both 16-bit and 32-bit operands and addressing.

The 80386 functions most efficiently when it is possible to distinguish
between pure 16-bit modules and pure 32-bit modules. A pure 16-bit module
has these characteristics:

    All segments occupy 64 Kilobytes or less.
    Data items are either 8 bits or 16 bits wide.
    Pointers to code and data have 16-bit offsets.
    Control is transferred only among 16-bit segments.

A pure 32-bit module has these characteristics:

    Segments may occupy more than 64 Kilobytes (zero bytes to 4 
     gigabytes).

    Data items are either 8 bits or 32 bits wide.

    Pointers to code and data have 32-bit offsets.

    Control is transferred only among 32-bit segments.

Pure 16-bit modules do exist; they are the modules designed for 16-bit
microprocessors. Pure 32-bit modules may exist in new programs designed
explicitly for the 80386. However, as systems designers move applications
from 16-bit processors to the 32-bit 80386, it will not always be possible
to maintain these ideals of pure 16-bit or 32-bit modules. It may be
expedient to execute old 16-bit modules in a new 32-bit environment without
making source-code changes to the old modules if any of the following
conditions is true:

    Modules will be converted one-by-one from 16-bit environments to
     32-bit environments.

    Older, 16-bit compilers and software-development tools will be
     utilized in the new32-bit operating environment until new 32-bit
     versions can be created.

    The source code of 16-bit modules is not available for modification.

    The specific data structures used by a given module inherently utilize
     16-bit words.

    The native word size of the source language is 16 bits.

On the 80386, 16-bit modules can be mixed with 32-bit modules. To design a
system that mixes 16- and 32-bit code requires an understanding of the
mechanisms that the 80386 uses to invoke and control its 32-bit and 16-bit
features.


16.1  How the 80386 Implements 16-Bit and 32-Bit Features

The features of the architecture that permit the 80386 to work equally well
with 32-bit and 16-bit address and operand sizes include:

    The D-bit (default bit) of code-segment descriptors, which determines
     the default choice of operand-size and address-size for the
     instructions of a code segment. (In real-address mode and V86 mode,
     which do not use descriptors, the default is 16 bits.) A code segment
     whose D-bit is set is known as a USE32 segment; a code segment whose
     D-bit is zero is a USE16 segment. The D-bit eliminates the need to
     encode the operand size and address size in instructions when all
     instructions use operands and effective addresses of the same size.

    Instruction prefixes that explicitly override the default choice of
     operand size and address size (available in protected mode as well as
     in real-address mode and V86 mode).

    Separate 32-bit and 16-bit gates for intersegment control transfers
     (including call gates, interrupt gates, and trap gates). The operand
     size for the control transfer is determined by the type of gate, not by
     the D-bit or prefix of the transfer instruction.

    Registers that can be used both for 32-bit and 16-bit operands and
     effective-address calculations.

    The B-bit (big bit) of data-segment descriptors, which determines the
     size of stack pointer (32-bit ESP or 16-bit SP) used by the CPU for
     implicit stack references.


16.2  Mixing 32-Bit and 16-Bit Operations

The 80386 has two instruction prefixes that allow mixing of 32-bit and
16-bit operations within one segment:

    The operand-size prefix (66H)
    The address-size prefix (67H)

These prefixes reverse the default size selected by the D-bit. For example,
the processor can interpret the word-move instruction MOV mem, reg in any of
four ways:

    In a USE32 segment:

     1.  Normally moves 32 bits from a 32-bit register to a 32-bit
         effective address in memory.

     2.  If preceded by an operand-size prefix, moves 16 bits from a 16-bit
         register to 32-bit effective address in memory.

     3.  If preceded by an address-size prefix, moves 32 bits from a 32-bit
         register to a16-bit effective address in memory.

     4.  If preceded by both an address-size prefix and an operand-size
         prefix, moves 16 bits from a 16-bit register to a 16-bit effective
         address in memory.

    In a USE16 segment:

     1.  Normally moves 16 bits from a 16-bit register to a 16-bit
         effective address in memory.

     2.  If preceded by an operand-size prefix, moves 32 bits from a 32-bit
         register to 16-bit effective address in memory.

     3.  If preceded by an address-size prefix, moves 16 bits from a 16-bit
         register to a32-bit effective address in memory.

     4.  If preceded by both an address-size prefix and an operand-size
         prefix, moves 32 bits from a 32-bit register to a 32-bit effective
         address in memory.

These examples illustrate that any instruction can generate any combination
of operand size and address size regardless of whether the instruction is in
a USE16 or USE32 segment. The choice of the USE16 or USE32 attribute for a
code segment is based upon these criteria:

  1.  The need to address instructions or data in segments that are larger
      than 64 Kilobytes.

  2.  The predominant size of operands.

  3.  The addressing modes desired. (Refer to Chapter 17 for an explanation
      of the additional addressing modes that are available when 32-bit
      addressing is used.)

Choosing a setting of the D-bit that is contrary to the predominant size of
operands requires the generation of an excessive number of operand-size
prefixes.


16.3  Sharing Data Segments Among Mixed Code Segments

Because the choice of operand size and address size is defined in code
segments and their descriptors, data segments can be shared freely among
both USE16 and USE32 code segments. The only limitation is the one imposed
by pointers with 16-bit offsets, which can only point to the first 64
Kilobytes of a segment. When a data segment that contains more than 64
Kilobytes is to be shared among USE32 and USE16 segments, the data that is
to be accessed by the USE16 segments must be located within the first 64
Kilobytes.

A stack that spans addresses less than 64K can be shared by both USE16 and
USE32 code segments. This class of stacks includes:

    Stacks in expand-up segments with G=0 and B=0.

    Stacks in expand-down segments with G=0 and B=0.

    Stacks in expand-up segments with G=1 and B=0, in which the stack is
     contained completely within the lower 64 Kilobytes. (Offsets greater
     than 64K can be used for data, other than the stack, that is not
     shared.)

The B-bit of a stack segment cannot, in general, be used to change the size
of stack used by a USE16 code segment. The size of stack pointer used by the
processor for implicit stack references is controlled by the B-bit of the
data-segment descriptor for the stack. Implicit references are those caused
by interrupts, exceptions, and instructions such as PUSH, POP, CALL, and
RET. One might be tempted, therefore, to try to increase beyond 64K the
size of the stack used by 16-bit code simply by supplying a larger stack
segment with the B-bit set. However, the B-bit does not control explicit
stack references, such as accesses to parameters or local variables. A USE16
code segment can utilize a "big" stack only if the code is modified so that
all explicit references to the stack are preceded by the address-size
prefix, causing those references to use 32-bit addressing.

In big, expand-down segments (B=1, G=1, and E=1), all offsets are greater
than 64K, therefore USE16 code cannot utilize such a stack segment unless
the code segment is modified to employ 32-bit addressing. (Refer to Chapter
6 for a review of the B, G, and E bits.)


16.4  Transferring Control Among Mixed Code Segments

When transferring control among procedures in USE16 and USE32 code
segments, programmers must be aware of three points:

    Addressing limitations imposed by pointers with 16-bit offsets.

    Matching of operand-size attribute in effect for the CALL/RET pair and
     theInterrupt/IRET pair so as to manage the stack correctly.

    Translation of parameters, especially pointer parameters.

Clearly, 16-bit effective addresses cannot be used to address data or code
located beyond 64K in a 32-bit segment, nor can large 32-bit parameters be
squeezed into a 16-bit word; however, except for these obvious limits, most
interfacing problems between 16-bit and 32-bit modules can be solved. Some
solutions involve inserting interface procedures between the procedures in
question.


16.4.1  Size of Code-Segment Pointer

For control-transfer instructions that use a pointer to identify the next
instruction (i.e., those that do not use gates), the size of the offset
portion of the pointer is determined by the operand-size attribute. The
implications of the use of two different sizes of code-segment pointer are:

    JMP, CALL, or RET from 32-bit segment to 16-bit segment is always
     possible using a 32-bit operand size.

    JMP, CALL, or RET from 16-bit segment using a 16-bit operand size
     cannot address the target in a 32-bit segment if the address of the
     target is greater than 64K.

An interface procedure can enable transfers from USE16 segments to 32-bit
addresses beyond 64K without requiring modifications any more extensive than
relinking or rebinding the old programs. The requirements for such an
interface procedure are discussed later in this chapter.


16.4.2  Stack Management for Control Transfers

Because stack management is different for 16-bit CALL/RET than for 32-bit
CALL/RET, the operand size of RET must match that of CALL. (Refer to Figure
16-1.) A 16-bit CALL pushes the 16-bit IP and (for calls between privilege
levels) the 16-bit SP register. The corresponding RET must also use a 16-bit
operand size to POP these 16-bit values from the stack into the 16-bit
registers. A 32-bit CALL pushes the 32-bit EIP and (for interlevel calls)
the 32-bit ESP register. The corresponding RET must also use a 32-bit
operand size to POP these 32-bit values from the stack into the 32-bit
registers. If the two halves of a CALL/RET pair do not have matching operand
sizes, the stack will not be managed correctly and the values of the
instruction pointer and stack pointer will not be restored to correct
values.

When the CALL and its corresponding RET are in segments that have D-bits
with the same values (i.e., both have 32-bit defaults or both have 16-bit
defaults), there is no problem. When the CALL and its corresponding RET are
in segments that have different D-bit values, however, programmers (or
program development software) must ensure that the CALL and RET match.

There are three ways to cause a 16-bit procedure to execute a 32-bit call:

  1.  Use a 16-bit call to a 32-bit interface procedure that then uses a
      32-bit call to invoke the intended target.

  2.  Bind the 16-bit call to a 32-bit call gate.

  3.  Modify the 16-bit procedure, inserting an operand-size prefix before
      the call, thereby changing it to a 32-bit call.

Likewise, there are three ways to cause a 32-bit procedure to execute a
16-bit call:

  1.  Use a 32-bit call to a 32-bit interface procedure that then uses a
      16-bit call to invoke the intended target.

  2.  Bind the 32-bit call to a 16-bit call gate.

  3.  Modify the 32-bit procedure, inserting an operand-size prefix before
      the call, thereby changing it to a 16-bit call. (Be certain that the
      return offset does not exceed 64K.)

Programmers can utilize any of the preceding methods to make a CALL in a
USE16 segment match the corresponding RET in a USE32 segment, or to make a
CALL in a USE32 segment match the corresponding RET in a USE16 segment.

16.4.2.1  Controlling the Operand-Size for a Call

When the selector of the pointer referenced by a CALL instruction selects a
segment descriptor, the operand-size attribute in effect for the CALL
instruction is determined by the D-bit in the segment descriptor and by any
operand-size instruction prefix.

When the selector of the pointer referenced by a CALL instruction selects a
gate descriptor, the type of call is determined by the type of call gate. A
call via an 80286 call gate (descriptor type 4)  always has a 16-bit
operand-size attribute; a call via an 80386 call gate (descriptor type 12)
always has a 32-bit operand-size attribute. The offset of the target
procedure is taken from the gate descriptor; therefore, even a 16-bit
procedure can call a procedure that is located more than 64 kilobytes from
the base of a 32-bit segment, because a 32-bit call gate contains a 32-bit
target offset.

An unmodified 16-bit code segment that has run successfully on an 8086 or
real-mode 80286 will always have a D-bit of zero and will not use
operand-size override prefixes; therefore, it will always execute 16-bit
versions of CALL. The only modification needed to make a16-bit procedure
effect a 32-bit call is to relink the call to an 80386 call gate.


16.4.2.2  Changing Size of Call

When adding 32-bit gates to 16-bit procedures, it is important to consider
the number of parameters. The count field of the gate descriptor specifies
the size of the parameter string to copy from the current stack to the stack
of the more privileged procedure. The count field of a 16-bit gate specifies
the number of words to be copied, whereas the count field of a 32-bit gate
specifies the number of doublewords to be copied; therefore, the 16-bit
procedure must use an even number of words as parameters.


16.4.3  Interrupt Control Transfers

With a control transfer due to an interrupt or exception, a gate is always
involved. The operand-size attribute for the interrupt is determined by the
type of IDT gate.

A 386 interrupt or trap gate (descriptor type 14 or 15) to a 32-bit
interrupt procedure can be used to interrupt either 32-bit or 16-bit
procedures. However, it is not generally feasible to permit an interrupt or
exception to invoke a 16-bit handler procedure when 32-bit code is
executing, because a 16-bit interrupt procedure has a return offset of only
16-bits on its stack. If the 32-bit procedure is executing at an address
greater than 64K, the 16-bit interrupt procedure cannot return correctly.


16.4.4  Parameter Translation

When segment offsets or pointers (which contain segment offsets) are passed
as parameters between 16-bit and 32-bit procedures, some translation is
required. Clearly, if a 32-bit procedure passes a pointer to data located
beyond 64K to a 16-bit procedure, the 16-bit procedure cannot utilize it.
Beyond this natural limitation, an interface procedure can perform any
format conversion between 32-bit and 16-bit pointers that may be needed.

Parameters passed by value between 32-bit and 16-bit code may also require
translation between 32-bit and 16-bit formats. Such translation requirements
are application dependent. Systems designers should take care to limit the
range of values passed so that such translations are possible.


16.4.5  The Interface Procedure

Interposing an interface procedure between 32-bit and 16-bit procedures can
be the solution to any of several interface requirements:

    Allowing procedures in 16-bit segments to transfer control to
     instructions located beyond 64K in 32-bit segments.

    Matching of operand size for CALL/RET.

    Parameter translation.

Interface procedures between USE32 and USE16 segments can be constructed
with these properties:

    The procedures reside in a code segment whose D-bit is set, indicating
     a default operand size of 32-bits.

    All entry points that may be called by 16-bit procedures have offsets
     that are actually less than 64K.

    All points to which called 16-bit procedures may return also lie
     within 64K.

The interface procedures do little more than call corresponding procedures
in other segments. There may be two kinds of procedures:

    Those that are called by 16-bit procedures and call 32-bit procedures.
     These interface procedures are called by 16-bit CALLs and use the
     operand-size prefix before RET instructions to cause a 16-bit RET.
     CALLs to 32-bit segments are 32-bit calls (by default, because the
     D-bit is set), and the 32-bit code returns with 32-bit RET
     instructions.

    Those that are called by 32-bit procedures and call 16-bit procedures.
     These interface procedures are called by 32-bit CALL instructions, and
     return with 32-bit RET instructions (by default, because the D-bit is
     set).  CALLs to 16-bit procedures use the operand-size prefix;
     procedures in the 16-bit code return with 16-bit RET instructions.

This chapter presents instructions for the 80386 in alphabetical order. For
each instruction, the forms are given for each operand combination,
including object code produced, operands required, execution time, and a
description. For each instruction, there is an operational description and a
summary of exceptions generated.


17.1  Operand-Size and Address-Size Attributes

When executing an instruction, the 80386 can address memory using either 16
or 32-bit addresses. Consequently, each instruction that uses memory
addresses has associated with it an address-size attribute of either 16 or
32 bits. 16-bit addresses imply both the use of a 16-bit displacement in
the instruction and the generation of a 16-bit address offset (segment
relative address) as the result of the effective address calculation.
32-bit addresses imply the use of a 32-bit displacement and the generation
of a 32-bit address offset. Similarly, an instruction that accesses words
(16 bits) or doublewords (32 bits) has an operand-size attribute of either
16 or 32 bits.

The attributes are determined by a combination of defaults, instruction
prefixes, and (for programs executing in protected mode) size-specification
bits in segment descriptors.


17.1.1  Default Segment Attribute

For programs executed in protected mode, the D-bit in executable-segment
descriptors determines the default attribute for both address size and
operand size. These default attributes apply to the execution of all
instructions in the segment. A value of zero in the D-bit sets the default
address size and operand size to 16 bits; a value of one, to 32 bits.

Programs that execute in real mode or virtual-8086 mode have 16-bit
addresses and operands by default.


17.1.2  Operand-Size and Address-Size Instruction Prefixes

The internal encoding of an instruction can include two byte-long prefixes:
the address-size prefix, 67H, and the operand-size prefix, 66H. (A later
section, "Instruction Format," shows the position of the prefixes in an
instruction's encoding.) These prefixes override the default segment
attributes for the instruction that follows. Table 17-1 shows the effect of
each possible combination of defaults and overrides.


17.1.3  Address-Size Attribute for Stack

Instructions that use the stack implicitly (for example: POP EAX also have
a stack address-size attribute of either 16 or 32 bits. Instructions with a
stack address-size attribute of 16 use the 16-bit SP stack pointer register;
instructions with a stack address-size attribute of 32 bits use the 32-bit
ESP register to form the address of the top of the stack.

The stack address-size attribute is controlled by the B-bit of the
data-segment descriptor in the SS register. A value of zero in the B-bit
selects a stack address-size attribute of 16; a value of one selects a stack
address-size attribute of 32.

Y = Yes, this instruction prefix is present
N = No, this instruction prefix is not present


17.2  Instruction Format

All instruction encodings are subsets of the general instruction format
shown in Figure 17-1. Instructions consist of optional instruction
prefixes, one or two primary opcode bytes, possibly an address specifier
consisting of the ModR/M byte and the SIB (Scale Index Base) byte, a
displacement, if required, and an immediate data field, if required.

Smaller encoding fields can be defined within the primary opcode or
opcodes. These fields define the direction of the operation, the size of the
displacements, the register encoding, or sign extension; encoding fields
vary depending on the class of operation.

Most instructions that can refer to an operand in memory have an addressing
form byte following the primary opcode byte(s). This byte, called the ModR/M
byte, specifies the address form to be used. Certain encodings of the ModR/M
byte indicate a second addressing byte, the SIB (Scale Index Base) byte,
which follows the ModR/M byte and is required to fully specify the
addressing form.

Addressing forms can include a displacement immediately following either
the ModR/M or SIB byte. If a displacement is present, it can be 8-, 16- or
32-bits.

If the instruction specifies an immediate operand, the immediate operand
always follows any displacement bytes. The immediate operand, if specified,
is always the last field of the instruction.

The following are the allowable instruction prefix codes:

   F3H    REP prefix (used only with string instructions)
   F3H    REPE/REPZ prefix (used only with string instructions
   F2H    REPNE/REPNZ prefix (used only with string instructions)
   F0H    LOCK prefix

The following are the segment override prefixes:

   2EH    CS segment override prefix
   36H    SS segment override prefix
   3EH    DS segment override prefix
   26H    ES segment override prefix
   64H    FS segment override prefix
   65H    GS segment override prefix
   66H    Operand-size override
   67H    Address-size override

17.2.1  ModR/M and SIB Bytes

The ModR/M and SIB bytes follow the opcode byte(s) in many of the 80386
instructions. They contain the following information:

    The indexing type or register number to be used in the instruction
    The register to be used, or more information to select the instruction
    The base, index, and scale information

The ModR/M byte contains three fields of information:

    The mod field, which occupies the two most significant bits of the 
     byte, combines with the r/m field to form 32 possible values: eight
     registers and 24 indexing modes

    The reg field, which occupies the next three bits following the mod
     field, specifies either a register number or three more bits of opcode
     information. The meaning of the reg field is determined by the first
     (opcode) byte of the instruction.

    The r/m field, which occupies the three least significant bits of the
     byte, can specify a register as the location of an operand, or can form
     part of the addressing-mode encoding in combination with the field as
     described above

The based indexed and scaled indexed forms of 32-bit addressing require the
SIB byte. The presence of the SIB byte is indicated by certain encodings of
the ModR/M byte. The SIB byte then includes the following fields:

    The ss field, which occupies the two most significant bits of the
     byte, specifies the scale factor

    The index field, which occupies the next three bits following the ss
     field and specifies the register number of the index register

    The base field, which occupies the three least significant bits of the
     byte, specifies the register number of the base register

Figure 17-2 shows the formats of the ModR/M and SIB bytes.

The values and the corresponding addressing forms of the ModR/M and SIB
bytes are shown in Tables 17-2, 17-3, and 17-4. The 16-bit addressing
forms specified by the ModR/M byte are in Table 17-2. The 32-bit addressing
forms specified by ModR/M are in Table 17-3. Table 17-4 shows the 32-bit
addressing forms specified by the SIB byte

17.2.2  How to Read the Instruction Set Pages

The following is an example of the format used for each 80386 instruction
description in this chapter:

CMC ฤฤ Complement Carry Flag

Opcode   Instruction         Clocks      Description

F5        CMC                  2            Complement carry flag

The above table is followed by paragraphs labelled "Operation,"
"Description," "Flags Affected," "Protected Mode Exceptions," "Real
Address Mode Exceptions," and, optionally, "Notes." The following sections
explain the notational conventions and abbreviations used in these
paragraphs of the instruction descriptions.


17.2.2.1  Opcode

The "Opcode" column gives the complete object code produced for each form
of the instruction. When possible, the codes are given as hexadecimal bytes,
in the same order in which they appear in memory. Definitions of entries
other than hexadecimal bytes are as follows:

/digit: (digit is between 0 and 7) indicates that the ModR/M byte of the
instruction uses only the r/m (register or memory) operand. The reg field
contains the digit that provides an extension to the instruction's opcode.

/r: indicates that the ModR/M byte of the instruction contains both a
register operand and an r/m operand.

cb, cw, cd, cp: a 1-byte (cb), 2-byte (cw), 4-byte (cd) or 6-byte (cp)
value following the opcode that is used to specify a code offset and
possibly a new value for the code segment register.

ib, iw, id: a 1-byte (ib), 2-byte (iw), or 4-byte (id) immediate operand to
the instruction that follows the opcode, ModR/M bytes or scale-indexing
bytes. The opcode determines if the operand is a signed value. All words and
doublewords are given with the low-order byte first.

+rb, +rw, +rd: a register code, from 0 through 7, added to the hexadecimal
byte given at the left of the plus sign to form a single opcode byte. The
codes areฤฤ

      rb         rw         rd
    AL = 0     AX = 0     EAX = 0
    CL = 1     CX = 1     ECX = 1
    DL = 2     DX = 2     EDX = 2
    BL = 3     BX = 3     EBX = 3
    AH = 4     SP = 4     ESP = 4
    CH = 5     BP = 5     EBP = 5
    DH = 6     SI = 6     ESI = 6
    BH = 7     DI = 7     EDI = 7


17.2.2.2  Instruction

The "Instruction" column gives the syntax of the instruction statement as
it would appear in an ASM386 program. The following is a list of the symbols
used to represent operands in the instruction statements:

rel8: a relative address in the range from 128 bytes before the end of the
instruction to 127 bytes after the end of the instruction.

rel16, rel32: a relative address within the same code segment as the
instruction assembled. rel16 applies to instructions with an operand-size
attribute of 16 bits; rel32 applies to instructions with an operand-size
attribute of 32 bits.

ptr16:16, ptr16:32: a FAR pointer, typically in a code segment different
from that of the instruction. The notation 16:16 indicates that the value of
the pointer has two parts. The value to the right of the colon is a 16-bit
selector or value destined for the code segment register. The value to the
left corresponds to the offset within the destination segment. ptr16:16 is
used when the instruction's operand-size attribute is 16 bits; ptr16:32 is
used with the 32-bit attribute.

r8: one of the byte registers AL, CL, DL, BL, AH, CH, DH, or BH.

r16: one of the word registers AX, CX, DX, BX, SP, BP, SI, or DI.

r32: one of the doubleword registers EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESP, EBP, ESI, or
EDI.

imm8: an immediate byte value. imm8 is a signed number between -128 and
+127 inclusive. For instructions in which imm8 is combined with a word or
doubleword operand, the immediate value is sign-extended to form a word or
doubleword. The upper byte of the word is filled with the topmost bit of the
immediate value.

imm16: an immediate word value used for instructions whose operand-size
attribute is 16 bits. This is a number between -32768 and +32767 inclusive.

imm32: an immediate doubleword value used for instructions whose
operand-size attribute is 32-bits. It allows the use of a number between
+2147483647 and -2147483648.

r/m8: a one-byte operand that is either the contents of a byte register
(AL, BL, CL, DL, AH, BH, CH, DH), or a byte from memory.

r/m16: a word register or memory operand used for instructions whose
operand-size attribute is 16 bits. The word registers are: AX, BX, CX, DX,
SP, BP, SI, DI. The contents of memory are found at the address provided by
the effective address computation.

r/m32: a doubleword register or memory operand used for instructions whose
operand-size attribute is 32-bits. The doubleword registers are: EAX, EBX,
ECX, EDX, ESP, EBP, ESI, EDI. The contents of memory are found at the
address provided by the effective address computation.

m8: a memory byte addressed by DS:SI or ES:DI (used only by string
instructions).

m16: a memory word addressed by DS:SI or ES:DI (used only by string
instructions).

m32: a memory doubleword addressed by DS:SI or ES:DI (used only by string
instructions).

m16:16, M16:32: a memory operand containing a far pointer composed of two
numbers. The number to the left of the colon corresponds to the pointer's
segment selector. The number to the right corresponds to its offset.

m16 & 32, m16 & 16, m32 & 32: a memory operand consisting of data item pairs
whose sizes are indicated on the left and the right side of the ampersand.
All memory addressing modes are allowed. m16 & 16 and m32 & 32 operands are
used by the BOUND instruction to provide an operand containing an upper and
lower bounds for array indices. m16 & 32 is used by LIDT and LGDT to
provide a word with which to load the limit field, and a doubleword with
which to load the base field of the corresponding Global and Interrupt
Descriptor Table Registers.

moffs8, moffs16, moffs32: (memory offset) a simple memory variable of type
BYTE, WORD, or DWORD used by some variants of the MOV instruction. The
actual address is given by a simple offset relative to the segment base. No
ModR/M byte is used in the instruction. The number shown with moffs
indicates its size, which is determined by the address-size attribute of the
instruction.

Sreg: a segment register. The segment register bit assignments are ES=0,
CS=1, SS=2, DS=3, FS=4, and GS=5.


17.2.2.3  Clocks

The "Clocks" column gives the number of clock cycles the instruction takes
to execute. The clock count calculations makes the following assumptions:

    The instruction has been prefetched and decoded and is ready for
     execution.

    Bus cycles do not require wait states.

    There are no local bus HOLD requests delaying processor access to the
     bus.

    No exceptions are detected during instruction execution.

    Memory operands are aligned.

Clock counts for instructions that have an r/m (register or memory) operand
are separated by a slash. The count to the left is used for a register
operand; the count to the right is used for a memory operand.

The following symbols are used in the clock count specifications:

    n, which represents a number of repetitions.

    m, which represents the number of components in the next instruction
     executed, where the entire displacement (if any) counts as one
     component, the entire immediate data (if any) counts as one component,
     and every other byte of the instruction and prefix(es) each counts as
     one component.

    pm=, a clock count that applies when the instruction executes in
     Protected Mode. pm= is not given when the clock counts are the same for
     Protected and Real Address Modes.

When an exception occurs during the execution of an instruction and the
exception handler is in another task, the instruction execution time is
increased by the number of clocks to effect a task switch. This parameter
depends on several factors:

    The type of TSS used to represent the current task (386 TSS or 286
     TSS).

    The type of TSS used to represent the new task.

    Whether the current task is in V86 mode.

    Whether the new task is in V86 mode.

Table 17-5 summarizes the task switch times for exceptions.

17.2.2.4  Description

The "Description" column following the "Clocks" column briefly explains the
various forms of the instruction. The "Operation" and "Description" sections
contain more details of the instruction's operation.


17.2.2.5  Operation

The "Operation" section contains an algorithmic description of the
instruction which uses a notation similar to the Algol or Pascal language.
The algorithms are composed of the following elements:

Comments are enclosed within the symbol pairs "(*" and "*)".

Compound statements are enclosed between the keywords of the "if" statement
(IF, THEN, ELSE, FI) or of the "do" statement (DO, OD), or of the "case"
statement (CASE ... OF, ESAC).

A register name implies the contents of the register. A register name
enclosed in brackets implies the contents of the location whose address is
contained in that register. For example, ES:[DI] indicates the contents of
the location whose ES segment relative address is in register DI. [SI]
indicates the contents of the address contained in register SI relative to
SI's default segment (DS) or overridden segment.

Brackets also used for memory operands, where they mean that the contents
of the memory location is a segment-relative offset. For example, [SRC]
indicates that the contents of the source operand is a segment-relative
offset.

A  B; indicates that the value of B is assigned to A.

The symbols =, <>, ๒, and ๓ are relational operators used to compare two
values, meaning equal, not equal, greater or equal, less or equal,
respectively. A relational expression such as A = B is TRUE if the value of
A is equal to B; otherwise it is FALSE.

The following identifiers are used in the algorithmic descriptions:

    OperandSize represents the operand-size attribute of the instruction,
     which is either 16 or 32 bits. AddressSize represents the address-size
     attribute, which is either 16 or 32 bits. For example,

   IF instruction = CMPSW
   THEN OperandSize  16;
   ELSE
      IF instruction = CMPSD
      THEN OperandSize  32;
      FI;
   FI;

indicates that the operand-size attribute depends on the form of the CMPS
instruction used. Refer to the explanation of address-size and operand-size
attributes at the beginning of this chapter for general guidelines on how
these attributes are determined.

    StackAddrSize represents the stack address-size attribute associated
     with the instruction, which has a value of 16 or 32 bits, as explained
     earlier in the chapter.

    SRC represents the source operand. When there are two operands, SRC is
     the one on the right.

    DEST represents the destination operand. When there are two operands,
     DEST is the one on the left.

    LeftSRC, RightSRC distinguishes between two operands when both are
     source operands.

    eSP represents either the SP register or the ESP register depending on
     the setting of the B-bit for the current stack segment.

The following functions are used in the algorithmic descriptions:

    Truncate to 16 bits(value) reduces the size of the value to fit in 16
     bits by discarding the uppermost bits as needed.

    Addr(operand) returns the effective address of the operand (the result
     of the effective address calculation prior to adding the segment base).

    ZeroExtend(value) returns a value zero-extended to the operand-size
     attribute of the instruction. For example, if OperandSize = 32,
     ZeroExtend of a byte value of -10 converts the byte from F6H to
     doubleword with hexadecimal value 000000F6H. If the value passed to
     ZeroExtend and the operand-size attribute are the same size,
     ZeroExtend returns the value unaltered.

    SignExtend(value) returns a value sign-extended to the operand-size
     attribute of the instruction. For example, if OperandSize = 32,
     SignExtend of a byte containing the value -10 converts the byte from
     F6H to a doubleword with hexadecimal value FFFFFFF6H. If the value
     passed to SignExtend and the operand-size attribute are the same size,
     SignExtend returns the value unaltered.

    Push(value) pushes a value onto the stack. The number of bytes pushed
     is determined by the operand-size attribute of the instruction. The
     action of Push is as follows:

   IF StackAddrSize = 16
   THEN
      IF OperandSize = 16
      THEN
         SP  SP - 2;
         SS:[SP]  value; (* 2 bytes assigned starting at
                             byte address in SP *)
      ELSE (* OperandSize = 32 *)
         SP  SP - 4;
         SS:[SP]  value; (* 4 bytes assigned starting at
                             byte address in SP *)
      FI;
   ELSE (* StackAddrSize = 32 *)
      IF OperandSize = 16
      THEN
         ESP  ESP - 2;
         SS:[ESP]  value; (* 2 bytes assigned starting at
                              byte address in ESP*)
      ELSE (* OperandSize = 32 *)
         ESP  ESP - 4;
         SS:[ESP]  value; (* 4 bytes assigned starting at
                              byte address in ESP*)
      FI;
   FI;

    Pop(value) removes the value from the top of the stack and returns it.
     The statement EAX  Pop( ); assigns to EAX the 32-bit value that Pop
     took from the top of the stack. Pop will return either a word or a
     doubleword depending on the operand-size attribute. The action of Pop
     is as follows:

   IF StackAddrSize = 16
   THEN
      IF OperandSize = 16
      THEN
         ret val  SS:[SP]; (* 2-byte value *)
         SP  SP + 2;
      ELSE (* OperandSize = 32 *)
         ret val  SS:[SP]; (* 4-byte value *)
         SP  SP + 4;
      FI;
   ELSE (* StackAddrSize = 32 *)
      IF OperandSize = 16
      THEN
         ret val  SS:[ESP]; (* 2 bytes value *)
         ESP  ESP + 2;
      ELSE (* OperandSize = 32 *)
         ret val  SS:[ESP]; (* 4 bytes value *)
         ESP  ESP + 4;
      FI;
   FI;
   RETURN(ret val); (*returns a word or doubleword*)

    Bit[BitBase, BitOffset] returns the address of a bit within a bit
     string, which is a sequence of bits in memory or a register. Bits are
     numbered from low-order to high-order within registers and within
     memory bytes. In memory, the two bytes of a word are stored with the
     low-order byte at the lower address.

   If the base operand is a register, the offset can be in the range 0..31.
   This offset addresses a bit within the indicated register. An example,
   "BIT[EAX, 21]," is illustrated in Figure 17-3.

   If BitBase is a memory address, BitOffset can range from -2 gigabits to 2
   gigabits. The addressed bit is numbered (Offset MOD 8) within the byte at
   address (BitBase + (BitOffset DIV 8)), where DIV is signed division with
   rounding towards negative infinity, and MOD returns a positive number.
   This is illustrated in Figure 17-4.

    I-O-Permission(I-O-Address, width) returns TRUE or FALSE depending on
   the I/O permission bitmap and other factors. This function is defined as
   follows:

   IF TSS type is 286 THEN RETURN FALSE; FI;
   Ptr  [TSS + 66]; (* fetch bitmap pointer *)
   BitStringAddr  SHR (I-O-Address, 3) + Ptr;
   MaskShift  I-O-Address AND 7;
   CASE width OF:
         BYTE: nBitMask  1;
         WORD: nBitMask  3;
         DWORD: nBitMask  15;
   ESAC;
   mask  SHL (nBitMask, MaskShift);
   CheckString  [BitStringAddr] AND mask;
   IF CheckString = 0
   THEN RETURN (TRUE);
   ELSE RETURN (FALSE);
   FI;

    Switch-Tasks is the task switching function described in Chapter 7.

17.2.2.7  Flags Affected

The "Flags Affected" section lists the flags that are affected by the
instruction, as follows:

    If a flag is always cleared or always set by the instruction, the
     value is given (0 or 1) after the flag name. Arithmetic and logical
     instructions usually assign values to the status flags in the uniform
     manner described in Appendix C. Nonconventional assignments are
     described in the "Operation" section.

    The values of flags listed as "undefined" may be changed by the
     instruction in an indeterminate manner.

All flags not listed are unchanged by the instruction.


17.2.2.8  Protected Mode Exceptions

This section lists the exceptions that can occur when the instruction is
executed in 80386 Protected Mode. The exception names are a pound sign (#)
followed by two letters and an optional error code in parentheses. For
example, #GP(0) denotes a general protection exception with an error code of
0. Table 17-6 associates each two-letter name with the corresponding
interrupt number.

Chapter 9 describes the exceptions and the 80386 state upon entry to the
exception.

Application programmers should consult the documentation provided with
their operating systems to determine the actions taken when exceptions
occur.


Table 17-6. 80386 Exceptions

Mnemonic     Interrupt    Description

#UD           6           Invalid opcode
#NM           7           Coprocessor not available

#MF          16           Math (coprocessor) fault


17.2.2.9  Real Address Mode Exceptions

Because less error checking is performed by the 80386 in Real Address Mode,
this mode has fewer exception conditions. Refer to Chapter 14 for further
information on these exceptions.


17.2.2.10  Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions

Virtual 8086 tasks provide the ability to simulate Virtual 8086 machines.
Virtual 8086 Mode exceptions are similar to those for the 8086 processor,
but there are some differences. Refer to Chapter 15 for details.


AAA ฤฤ ASCII Adjust after Addition

Opcode    Instruction    Clocks    Description

37        AAA            4         ASCII adjust AL after addition


Operation

IF ((AL AND 0FH) > 9) OR (AF = 1)
THEN
   AL  (AL + 6) AND 0FH;
   AH  AH + 1;
   AF  1;
   CF  1;
ELSE
   CF  0;
   AF  0;
FI;

Description

Execute AAA only following an ADD instruction that leaves a byte result
in the AL register. The lower nibbles of the operands of the ADD instruction
should be in the range 0 through 9 (BCD digits). In this case, AAA adjusts
AL to contain the correct decimal digit result. If the addition produced a
decimal carry, the AH register is incremented, and the carry and auxiliary
carry flags are set to 1. If there was no decimal carry, the carry and
auxiliary flags are set to 0 and AH is unchanged. In either case, AL is left
with its top nibble set to 0. To convert AL to an ASCII result, follow the
AAA instruction with OR AL, 30H.

Flags Affected

AF and CF as described above; OF, SF, ZF, and PF are undefined

AAD ฤฤ ASCII Adjust AX before Division

Opcode    Instruction    Clocks    Description

D5 0A     AAD            19        ASCII adjust AX before division


Operation

AL  AH * 10 + AL;
AH  0;

Description

AAD is used to prepare two unpacked BCD digits (the least-significant
digit in AL, the most-significant digit in AH) for a division operation that
will yield an unpacked result. This is accomplished by setting AL to
AL + (10 * AH), and then setting AH to 0. AX is then equal to the binary
equivalent of the original unpacked two-digit number.

Flags Affected

SF, ZF, and PF as described in Appendix C; OF, AF, and CF are undefined

AAM ฤฤ ASCII Adjust AX after Multiply

Opcode    Instruction    Clocks    Description

D4 0A     AAM            17        ASCII adjust AX after multiply


Operation

AH  AL / 10;
AL  AL MOD 10;

Description

Execute AAM only after executing a MUL instruction between two unpacked
BCD digits that leaves the result in the AX register. Because the result is
less than 100, it is contained entirely in the AL register. AAM unpacks the
AL result by dividing AL by 10, leaving the quotient (most-significant
digit) in AH and the remainder (least-significant digit) in AL.

Flags Affected

SF, ZF, and PF as described in Appendix C; OF, AF, and CF are undefined

AAS ฤฤ ASCII Adjust AL after Subtraction

Opcode    Instruction    Clocks    Description

3F        AAS            4         ASCII adjust AL after subtraction


Operation

IF (AL AND 0FH) > 9 OR AF = 1
THEN
   AL  AL - 6;
   AL  AL AND 0FH;
   AH  AH - 1;
   AF  1;
   CF  1;
ELSE
   CF  0;
   AF  0;
FI;

Description

Execute AAS only after a SUB instruction that leaves the byte result in the
AL register. The lower nibbles of the operands of the SUB instruction must
have been in the range 0 through 9 (BCD digits). In this case, AAS adjusts
AL so it contains the correct decimal digit result. If the subtraction
produced a decimal carry, the AH register is decremented, and the carry and
auxiliary carry flags are set to 1. If no decimal carry occurred, the carry
and auxiliary carry flags are set to 0, and AH is unchanged. In either case,
AL is left with its top nibble set to 0. To convert AL to an ASCII result,
follow the AAS with OR AL, 30H.

13 /r     ADC r32,r/m32    2/6       Add with CF r/m dword to dword register


Operation

DEST  DEST + SRC + CF;

Description

ADC performs an integer addition of the two operands DEST and SRC and the
carry flag, CF. The result of the addition is assigned to the first operand
(DEST), and the flags are set accordingly. ADC is usually executed as part
of a multi-byte or multi-word addition operation. When an immediate byte
value is added to a word or doubleword operand, the immediate value is first
sign-extended to the size of the word or doubleword operand.

ARPL ฤฤ Adjust RPL Field of Selector

Opcode    Instruction          Clocks    Description

Operation

IF RPL bits(0,1) of DEST < RPL bits(0,1) of SRC
THEN
   ZF  1;
   RPL bits(0,1) of DEST  RPL bits(0,1) of SRC;
ELSE
   ZF  0;
FI;

Description

The ARPL instruction has two operands. The first operand is a 16-bit
memory variable or word register that contains the value of a selector. The
second operand is a word register. If the RPL field ("requested privilege
level"ฤฤbottom two bits) of the first operand is less than the RPL field of
the second operand, the zero flag is set to 1 and the RPL field of the
first operand is increased to match the second operand. Otherwise, the zero
flag is set to 0 and no change is made to the first operand.

ARPL appears in operating system software, not in application programs. It
is used to guarantee that a selector parameter to a subroutine does not
request more privilege than the caller is allowed. The second operand of
ARPL is normally a register that contains the CS selector value of the
caller.

Flags Affected

ZF as described above

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if the result is in a nonwritable segment; #GP(0) for an illegal
memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segments;

BOUND ฤฤ Check Array Index Against Bounds

Opcode    Instruction          Clocks    Description

                                         (passes test)


Operation

IF (LeftSRC < [RightSRC] OR LeftSRC > [RightSRC + OperandSize/8])
   (* Under lower bound or over upper bound *)
THEN Interrupt 5;
FI;

Description

BOUND ensures that a signed array index is within the limits specified by a
block of memory consisting of an upper and a lower bound. Each bound uses
one word for an operand-size attribute of 16 bits and a doubleword for an
operand-size attribute of 32 bits. The first operand (a register) must be
greater than or equal to the first bound in memory (lower bound), and less
than or equal to the second bound in memory (upper bound). If the register
is not within bounds, an Interrupt 5 occurs; the return EIP points to the
BOUND instruction.

The bounds limit data structure is usually placed just before the array
itself, making the limits addressable via a constant offset from the
beginning of the array.

Flags Affected

None

Protected Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 5 if the bounds test fails, as described above; #GP(0) for an
illegal memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS
segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code)
for a page fault

The second operand must be a memory operand, not a register. If BOUND is
executed with a ModRM byte representing a register as the second operand,
#UD occurs.

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 5 if the bounds test fails; Interrupt 13 if any part of the
operand would lie outside of the effective address space from 0 to 0FFFFH;

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault

Notes

The index of the selected bit can be given by the immediate constant in the
instruction or by a value in a general register. Only an 8-bit immediate
value is used in the instruction. This operand is taken modulo 32, so the
range of immediate bit offsets is 0..31. This allows any bit within a
register to be selected. For memory bit strings, this immediate field gives
only the bit offset within a word or doubleword. Immediate bit offsets
larger than 31 are supported by using the immediate bit offset field in
combination with the displacement field of the memory operand. The low-order
3 to 5 bits of the immediate bit offset are stored in the immediate bit
offset field, and the high-order 27 to 29 bits are shifted and combined with
the byte displacement in the addressing mode.

When accessing a bit in memory, the 80386 may access four bytes starting
from the memory address given by:

   Effective Address + (4 * (BitOffset DIV 32))

for a 32-bit operand size, or two bytes starting from the memory address
given by:

   Effective Address + (2 * (BitOffset DIV 16))

for a 16-bit operand size. It may do so even when only a single byte needs
to be accessed in order to reach the given bit. You must therefore avoid
referencing areas of memory close to address space holes. In particular,
avoid references to memory-mapped I/O registers. Instead, use the MOV
instructions to load from or store to these addresses, and use the register
form of these instructions to manipulate the data.

Description

The CALL instruction causes the procedure named in the operand to be
executed. When the procedure is complete (a return instruction is executed
within the procedure), execution continues at the instruction that follows
the CALL instruction.

The action of the different forms of the instruction are described below.

Near calls are those with destinations of type r/m16, r/m32, rel16, rel32;
changing or saving the segment register value is not necessary. The CALL
rel16 and CALL rel32 forms add a signed offset to the address of the
instruction following CALL to determine the destination. The rel16 form is
used when the instruction's operand-size attribute is 16 bits; rel32 is used
when the operand-size attribute is 32 bits. The result is stored in the
32-bit EIP register. With rel16, the upper 16 bits of EIP are cleared,
resulting in an offset whose value does not exceed 16 bits. CALL r/m16 and
CALL r/m32 specify a register or memory location from which the absolute
segment offset is fetched. The offset fetched from r/m is 32 bits for an
operand-size attribute of 32 (r/m32), or 16 bits for an operand-size of 16
(r/m16). The offset of the instruction following CALL is pushed onto the
stack. It will be popped by a near RET instruction within the procedure. The
CS register is not changed by this form of CALL.

The far calls, CALL ptr16:16 and CALL ptr16:32, use a four-byte or six-byte
operand as a long pointer to the procedure called. The CALL m16:16 and
m16:32 forms fetch the long pointer from the memory location
specified (indirection). In Real Address Mode or Virtual 8086 Mode, the long
pointer provides 16 bits for the CS register and 16 or 32 bits for the EIP
register (depending on the operand-size attribute). These forms of the
instruction push both CS and IP or EIP as a return address.

In Protected Mode, both long pointer forms consult the AR byte in the
descriptor indexed by the selector part of the long pointer. Depending on
the value of the AR byte, the call will perform one of the following types
of control transfers:

    A far call to the same protection level
    An inter-protection level far call
    A task switch

For more information on Protected Mode control transfers, refer to
Chapter 6 and Chapter 7.

Flags Affected

All flags are affected if a task switch occurs; no flags are affected if a
task switch does not occur

Protected Mode Exceptions

For far calls: #GP, #NP, #SS, and #TS, as indicated in the list above

For near direct calls: #GP(0) if procedure location is beyond the code
segment limits; #SS(0) if pushing the return address exceeds the bounds of
the stack segment; #PF (fault-code) for a page fault

For a near indirect call: #GP(0) for an illegal memory operand effective
address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address
in the SS segment; #GP(0) if the indirect offset obtained is beyond the code
segment limits; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault

Notes

Any far call from a 32-bit code segment to 16-bit code segments should be
made from the first 64K bytes of the 32-bit code segment, since the
operand-size attribute of the instruction is set to 16, thus allowing only a
16-bit return address offset to be saved.


CBW/CWDE ฤฤ Convert Byte to Word/Convert Word to Doubleword

CLTS ฤฤ Clear Task-Switched Flag in CR0

Opcode    Instruction    Clocks   Description

Operation

TS Flag in CR0  0;

Description

CLTS clears the task-switched (TS) flag in register CR0. This flag is set by
the 80386 every time a task switch occurs. The TS flag is used to manage
processor extensions as follows:

    Every execution of an ESC instruction is trapped if the TS flag is set.

    Execution of a WAIT instruction is trapped if the MP flag and the TS
     flag are both set.

Thus, if a task switch was made after an ESC instruction was begun, the
processor extension's context may need to be saved before a new ESC
instruction can be issued. The fault handler saves the context and resets
the TS flag.

CLTS appears in operating system software, not in application programs. It
is a privileged instruction that can only be executed at privilege level 0.

Flags Affected

TS = 0 (TS is in CR0, not the flag register)

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if CLTS is executed with a current privilege level other than 0

Description

CMPS compares the byte, word, or doubleword pointed to by the source-index
register with the byte, word, or doubleword pointed to by the
destination-index register.

If the address-size attribute of this instruction is 16 bits, SI and DI
will be used for source- and destination-index registers; otherwise ESI and
EDI will be used. Load the correct index values into SI and DI (or ESI and
EDI) before executing CMPS.

The comparison is done by subtracting the operand indexed by
the destination-index register from the operand indexed by the source-index
register.

Note that the direction of subtraction for CMPS is [SI] - [DI] or
[ESI] - [EDI]. The left operand (SI or ESI) is the source and the right
operand (DI or EDI) is the destination. This is the reverse of the usual
Intel convention in which the left operand is the destination and the right
operand is the source.

The result of the subtraction is not stored; only the flags reflect the
change. The types of the operands determine whether bytes, words, or
doublewords are compared. For the first operand (SI or ESI), the DS register
is used, unless a segment override byte is present. The second operand (DI
or EDI) must be addressable from the ES register; no segment override is
possible.

After the comparison is made, both the source-index register and
destination-index register are automatically advanced. If the direction flag
is 0 (CLD was executed), the registers increment; if the direction flag is 1
(STD was executed), the registers decrement. The registers increment or
decrement by 1 if a byte is compared, by 2 if a word is compared, or by 4 if
a doubleword is compared.

CMPSB, CMPSW and CMPSD are synonyms for the byte, word, and
doubleword CMPS instructions, respectively.

CMPS can be preceded by the REPE or REPNE prefix for block comparison of CX
or ECX bytes, words, or doublewords. Refer to the description of the REP
instruction for more information on this operation.

Description

ENTER creates the stack frame required by most block-structured
high-level languages. The first operand specifies the number of bytes of
dynamic storage allocated on the stack for the routine being entered.
The second operand gives the lexical nesting level (0 to 31) of the routine
within the high-level language source code. It determines the number of
stack frame pointers copied into the new stack frame from the preceding
frame. BP (or EBP, if the operand-size attribute is 32 bits) is the current
stack frame pointer.

If the operand-size attribute is 16 bits, the processor uses BP as the
frame pointer and SP as the stack pointer. If the operand-size attribute is
32 bits, the processor uses EBP for the frame pointer and ESP for the stack
pointer.

If the second operand is 0, ENTER pushes the frame pointer (BP or
EBP) onto the stack; ENTER then subtracts the first operand from the
stack pointer and sets the frame pointer to the current stack-pointer
value.

For example, a procedure with 12 bytes of local variables would have an
ENTER 12,0 instruction at its entry point and a LEAVE instruction
before every RET. The 12 local bytes would be addressed as negative
offsets from the frame pointer.

Description

IDIV performs a signed division. The dividend, quotient, and remainder
are implicitly allocated to fixed registers. Only the divisor is given as
an explicit r/m operand. The type of the divisor determines which registers
to use as follows:

Size     Divisor    Quotient    Remainder  Dividend
byte     r/m8        AL           AH       AX
word     r/m16       AX           DX       DX:AX
dword    r/m32       EAX          EDX      EDX:EAX

If the resulting quotient is too large to fit in the destination, or if the
division is 0, an Interrupt 0 is generated. Nonintegral quotients are
truncated toward 0. The remainder has the same sign as the dividend
and the absolute value of the remainder is always less than the absolute
value of the divisor.

Flags Affected

OF, SF, ZF, AR, PF, CF are undefined.

Protected Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 0 if the quotient is too large to fit in the designated register
(AL or AX), or if the divisor is 0; #GP (0) for an illegal memory operand
effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segments; #SS(0) for an
illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 0 if the quotient is too large to fit in the designated register
(AL or AX), or if the divisor is 0; Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand
would lie outside of the effective address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

NOTES:
  The 80386 uses an early-out multiply algorithm. The actual number of
  clocks depends on the position of the most significant bit in the
  optimizing multiplier, shown underlined above. The optimization occurs for
  positive and negative values. Because of the early-out algorithm, clock
  counts given are minimum to maximum. To calculate the actual clocks, use
  the following formula:
ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ

  Actual clock = if m <> 0 then max(ceiling(log{2} ณmณ), 3) + 6 clocks  
  Actual clock = if m = 0 then 9 clocks   
  (where m is the multiplier)

Add three clocks if the multiplier is a memory operand.

Description

IMUL performs signed multiplication. Some forms of the instruction
use implicit register operands. The operand combinations for all forms
of the instruction are shown in the "Description" column above.

IMUL clears the overflow and carry flags under the following conditions:

   Instruction Form    Condition for Clearing CF and OF
   r/m8                AL = sign-extend of AL to 16 bits
   r/m16               AX = sign-extend of AX to 32 bits
   r/m32               EDX:EAX = sign-extend of EAX to 32 bits
   r16,r/m16           Result exactly fits within r16
   r/32,r/m32          Result exactly fits within r32
   r16,r/m16,imm16     Result exactly fits within r16
   r32,r/m32,imm32     Result exactly fits within r32

Flags Affected

OF and CF as described above; SF, ZF, AF, and PF are undefined

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) for an illegal memory operand effective address in the CS, DS,
ES, FS, or GS segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment;
#PF(fault-code) for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exeptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page

Notes

When using the accumulator forms (IMUL r/m8, IMUL r/m16, or IMUL
r/m32), the result of the multiplication is available even if the overflow
flag is set because the result is two times the size of the multiplicand
and multiplier. This is large enough to handle any possible result.

Description

INS transfers data from the input port numbered by the DX register to
the memory byte or word at ES:dest-index. The memory operand must
be addressable from ES; no segment override is possible. The destination
register is DI if the address-size attribute of the instruction is 16 bits,
or EDI if the address-size attribute is 32 bits.

INS does not allow the specification of the port number as an immediate
value. The port must be addressed through the DX register value. Load
the correct value into DX before executing the INS instruction.

The destination address is determined by the contents of the destination
index register. Load the correct index into the destination index register
before executing INS.

After the transfer is made, DI or EDI advances automatically. If the
direction flag is 0 (CLD was executed), DI or EDI increments; if the
direction flag is 1 (STD was executed), DI or EDI decrements. DI
increments or decrements by 1 if a byte is input, by 2 if a word is input,
or by 4 if a doubleword is input.

INSB, INSW and INSD are synonyms of the byte, word, and doubleword
INS instructions. INS can be preceded by the REP prefix for block input of
CX bytes or words. Refer to the REP instruction for details of this
operation.

Description

The INT  instruction generates via software a call to an interrupt
handler. The immediate operand, from 0 to 255, gives the index number
into the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) of the interrupt routine to be
called. In Protected Mode, the IDT consists of an array of eight-byte
descriptors; the descriptor for the interrupt invoked must indicate an
interrupt, trap, or task gate. In Real Address Mode, the IDT is an array
of four byte-long pointers. In Protected and Real Address Modes, the
base linear address of the IDT is defined by the contents of the IDTR.

The INTO conditional software instruction is identical to the INT
interrupt instruction except that the interrupt number is implicitly 4,
and the interrupt is made only if the 80386 overflow flag is set.

The first 32 interrupts are reserved by Intel for system use. Some of
these interrupts are use for internally generated exceptions.

INT n generally behaves like a far call except that the flags register is
pushed onto the stack before the return address. Interrupt procedures
return via the IRET instruction, which pops the flags and return address
from the stack.

In Real Address Mode, INT n pushes the flags, CS, and the return IP
onto the stack, in that order, then jumps to the long pointer indexed by
the interrupt number.

Flags Affected

None

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP, #NP, #SS, and #TS as indicated under "Operation" above

Real Address Mode Exceptions

None; if the SP or ESP = 1, 3, or 5 before executing INT or INTO,
the 80386 will shut down due to insufficient stack space

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) fault if IOPL is less than 3, for INT  only, to permit emulation;
Interrupt 3 (0CCH) generates Interrupt 3; INTO generates Interrupt 4
if the overflow flag equals 1

Description

In Real Address Mode, IRET pops the instruction pointer, CS, and the
flags register from the stack and resumes the interrupted routine.

In Protected Mode, the action of IRET depends on the setting of the
nested task flag (NT) bit in the flag register. When popping the new
flag image from the stack, the IOPL bits in the flag register are changed
only when CPL equals 0.

If NT equals 0, IRET returns from an interrupt procedure without a
task switch. The code returned to must be equally or less privileged than
the interrupt routine (as indicated by the RPL bits of the CS selector
popped from the stack). If the destination code is less privileged, IRET
also pops the stack pointer and SS from the stack.

If NT equals 1, IRET reverses the operation of a CALL or INT that
caused a task switch. The updated state of the task executing IRET is
saved in its task state segment. If the task is reentered later, the code
that follows IRET is executed.

Flags Affected

All; the flags register is popped from stack

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP, #NP, or #SS, as indicated under "Operation" above

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand being popped lies beyond address
0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) fault if IOPL is less than 3, to permit emulation

Description

Conditional jumps (except JCXZ) test the flags which have been set by
a previous instruction. The conditions for each mnemonic are given in
parentheses after each description above. The terms "less" and "greater"
are used for comparisons of signed integers; "above" and "below" are
used for unsigned integers.

If the given condition is true, a jump is made to the location provided as
the operand. Instruction coding is most efficient when the target for the
conditional jump is in the current code segment and within -128 to
+127 bytes of the next instruction's first byte. The jump can also target
-32768 thru +32767 (segment size attribute 16) or -2^(31) thru +2^(31) -1
(segment size attribute 32) relative to the next instruction's first byte.
When the target for the conditional jump is in a different segment, use
the opposite case of the jump instruction (i.e., JE and JNE), and then
access the target with an unconditional far jump to the other segment.
For example, you cannot codeฤฤ

JZ FARLABEL;

You must instead codeฤฤ

   JNZ BEYOND;
   JMP FARLABEL;
BEYOND:

Because there can be several ways to interpret a particular state of the
flags, ASM386 provides more than one mnemonic for most of the
conditional jump opcodes. For example, if you compared two characters in
AX and want to jump if they are equal, use JE; or, if you ANDed AX
with a bit field mask and only want to jump if the result is 0, use JZ, a
synonym for JE.

JCXZ differs from other conditional jumps because it tests the contents of
the CX or ECX register for 0, not the flags. JCXZ is useful at the beginning
of a conditional loop that terminates with a conditional loop instruction
(such as LOOPNE TARGET LABEL. The JCXZ prevents entering the loop with CX or
ECX equal to zero, which would cause the loop to execute 64K or 32G times
instead of zero times.

Flags Affected

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if the offset jumped to is beyond the limits of the code segment

Description

The JMP instruction transfers control to a different point in the
instruction stream without recording return information.

The action of the various forms of the instruction are shown below.

Jumps with destinations of type r/m16, r/m32, rel16, and rel32 are near
jumps and do not involve changing the segment register value.

The JMP rel16 and JMP rel32 forms of the instruction add an offset to
the address of the instruction following the JMP to determine the
destination. The rel16 form is used when the instruction's operand-size
attribute is 16 bits (segment size attribute 16 only); rel32 is used when
the operand-size attribute is 32 bits (segment size attribute 32 only). The
result is stored in the 32-bit EIP register. With rel16, the upper 16 bits
of EIP are cleared, which results in an offset whose value does not exceed
16 bits.

JMP r/m16 and JMP r/m32 specifies a register or memory location from which
the absolute offset from the procedure is fetched. The offset fetched from
r/m is 32 bits for an operand-size attribute of 32 bits (r/m32), or 16 bits
for an operand-size attribute of 16 bits (r/m16).

The JMP ptr16:16 and ptr16:32 forms of the instruction use a four-byte
or six-byte operand as a long pointer to the destination. The JMP
and  forms fetch the long pointer from the memory location
specified (indirection). In Real Address Mode or Virtual 8086 Mode,
the long pointer provides 16 bits for the CS register and 16 or 32 bits
for the EIP register (depending on the operand-size attribute). In
Protected Mode, both long pointer forms consult the Access Rights (AR)
byte in the descriptor indexed by the selector part of the long pointer.

Depending on the value of the AR byte, the jump will perform one of
the following types of control transfers:

    A jump to a code segment at the same privilege level
    A task switch

For more information on protected mode control transfers, refer to
Chapter 6 and Chapter 7.

Flags Affected

All if a task switch takes place; none if no task switch occurs

Protected Mode Exceptions

Far jumps: #GP, #NP, #SS, and #TS, as indicated in the list above.

Near direct jumps: #GP(0) if procedure location is beyond the code
segment limits.

Near indirect jumps: #GP(0) for an illegal memory operand effective
address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segments: #SS(0) for an illegal
address in the SS segment; #GP if the indirect offset obtained is beyond
the code segment limits; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault.

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would be outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

LAR ฤฤ Load Access Rights Byte

Opcode        Instruction      Clocks      Description

0F  02 /r     LAR r16,r/m16    pm=15/16    r16  r/m16 masked by FF00
0F  02 /r     LAR r32,r/m32    pm=15/16    r32  r/m32 masked by 00FxFF00


Description

The LAR instruction stores a marked form of the second doubleword of
the descriptor for the source selector if the selector is visible at the
CPL (modified by the selector's RPL) and is a valid descriptor type. The
destination register is loaded with the high-order doubleword of the
descriptor masked by 00FxFF00, and ZF is set to 1. The x indicates that the
four bits corresponding to the upper four bits of the limit are undefined in
the value loaded by LAR. If the selector is invisible or of the wrong type,
ZF is cleared.

If the 32-bit operand size is specified, the entire 32-bit value is loaded
into the 32-bit destination register. If the 16-bit operand size is
specified, the lower 16-bits of this value are stored in the 16-bit
destination register.

All code and data segment descriptors are valid for LAR.

The valid special segment and gate descriptor types for LAR are given
in the following table:

Type   Name                     Valid/Invalid

Description

LEA calculates the effective address (offset part) and stores it in the
specified register. The operand-size attribute of the instruction
(represented by OperandSize in the algorithm under "Operation" above) is
determined by the chosen register. The address-size attribute (represented
by AddressSize) is determined by the USE attribute of the segment containing
the second operand. The address-size and operand-size attributes affect the
action performed by LEA, as follows:

Operand Size  Address Size  Action Performed

    16            16        16-bit effective address is calculated and
                            stored in requested 16-bit register
                            destination.

    16            32        32-bit effective address is calculated. The
                            lower 16 bits of the address are stored in
                            the requested 16-bit register destination.

    32            16        16-bit effective address is calculated. The
                            16-bit address is zero-extended and stored
                            in the requested 32-bit register destination.

    32            32        32-bit effective address is calculated and

Description

LEAVE reverses the actions of the ENTER instruction. By copying the
frame pointer to the stack pointer, LEAVE releases the stack space used
by a procedure for its local variables. The old frame pointer is popped
into BP or EBP, restoring the caller's frame. A subsequent RET
instruction removes any arguments pushed onto the stack of the exiting
procedure.

   THEN GDTR.Limit:Base  m16:24 (* 24 bits of base loaded *)
   ELSE GDTR.Limit:Base  m16:32;
   FI;
FI;

Description

The LGDT and LIDT instructions load a linear base address and limit
value from a six-byte data operand in memory into the GDTR or IDTR,
respectively. If a 16-bit operand is used with LGDT or LIDT, the
register is loaded with a 16-bit limit and a 24-bit base, and the
high-order eight bits of the six-byte data operand are not used. If a 32-bit
operand is used, a 16-bit limit and a 32-bit base is loaded; the high-order
eight bits of the six-byte operand are used as high-order base address bits.

The SGDT and SIDT instructions always store into all 48 bits of the
six-byte data operand. With the 80286, the upper eight bits are undefined
after SGDT or SIDT is executed. With the 80386, the upper eight bits
are written with the high-order eight address bits, for both a 16-bit
operand and a 32-bit operand. If LGDT or LIDT is used with a 16-bit
operand to load the register stored by SGDT or SIDT, the upper eight
bits are stored as zeros.

LGDT and LIDT appear in operating system software; they are not used
in application programs. They are the only instructions that directly load
a linear address (i.e., not a segment relative address) in 80386 Protected
Mode.

Description

These instructions read a full pointer from memory and store it in the
selected segment register:register pair. The full pointer loads 16 bits
into the segment register SS, DS, ES, FS, or GS. The other register loads 32
bits if the operand-size attribute is 32 bits, or loads 16 bits if the
operand-size attribute is 16 bits. The other 16- or 32-bit register to be
loaded is determined by the r16 or r32 register operand specified.

When an assignment is made to one of the segment registers, the
descriptor is also loaded into the segment register. The data for the
register is obtained from the descriptor table entry for the selector
given.

A null selector (values 0000-0003) can be loaded into DS, ES, FS, or
GS registers without causing a protection exception. (Any subsequent
reference to a segment whose corresponding segment register is loaded
with a null selector to address memory causes a #GP(0) exception. No
memory reference to the segment occurs.)

the loading of a segment register:

   IF selector is null THEN #GP(0); FI;
   Selector index must be within its descriptor table limits ELSE

LLDT ฤฤ Load Local Descriptor Table Register

Opcode      Instruction      Clocks   Description

0F  00 /2   LLDT r/m16       20       Load selector r/m16 into LDTR


Operation

LDTR  SRC;

Description

LLDT loads the Local Descriptor Table register (LDTR). The word
operand (memory or register) to LLDT should contain a selector to the
Global Descriptor Table (GDT). The GDT entry should be a Local Descriptor
Table. If so, then the LDTR is loaded from the entry. The descriptor
registers DS, ES, SS, FS, GS, and CS are not affected. The LDT field in the
task state segment does not change.

The selector operand can be 0; if so, the LDTR is marked invalid. All
descriptor references (except by the LAR, VERR, VERW or LSL
instructions) cause a #GP fault.

LLDT is used in operating system software; it is not used in application
programs.

Flags Affected

Description

LMSW loads the machine status word (part of CR0) from the source
operand. This instruction can be used to switch to Protected Mode; if so,
it must be followed by an intrasegment jump to flush the instruction
queue. LMSW will not switch back to Real Address Mode.

LMSW is used only in operating system software. It is not used in

LOCK ฤฤ Assert LOCK# Signal Prefix

Opcode  Instruction  Clocks  Description

F0      LOCK         0       Assert LOCK# signal for the next instruction


Description

The LOCK prefix causes the LOCK# signal of the 80386 to be asserted
during execution of the instruction that follows it. In a multiprocessor
environment, this signal can be used to ensure that the 80386 has
exclusive use of any shared memory while LOCK# is asserted. The
read-modify-write sequence typically used to implement test-and-set on the
80386 is the BTS instruction.

The LOCK prefix functions only with the following instructions:

BT, BTS, BTR, BTC                   mem, reg/imm
XCHG                                reg, mem
XCHG                                mem, reg
ADD, OR, ADC, SBB, AND, SUB, XOR    mem, reg/imm
NOT, NEG, INC, DEC                  mem

An undefined opcode trap will be generated if a LOCK prefix is used
with any instruction not listed above.

XCHG always asserts LOCK# regardless of the presence or absence of
the LOCK prefix.

The integrity of the LOCK is not affected by the alignment of the
memory field. Memory locking is observed for arbitrarily misaligned
fields.

Locked access is not assured if another 80386 processor is executing an
instruction concurrently that has one of the following characteristics:

    Is not preceded by a LOCK prefix

    Is not one of the instructions in the preceding list

    Specifies a memory operand that does not exactly overlap the
     destination operand. Locking is not guaranteed for partial overlap,
     even if one memory operand is wholly contained within another.

      IF DF = 0 THEN IncDec  4 ELSE IncDec  -4; FI;
   FI;
FI;
source-index  source-index + IncDec

Description

LODS loads the AL, AX, or EAX register with the memory byte, word,
or doubleword at the location pointed to by the source-index register.
After the transfer is made, the source-index register is automatically
advanced. If the direction flag is 0 (CLD was executed), the source index
increments; if the direction flag is 1 (STD was executed), it decrements.
The increment or decrement is 1 if a byte is loaded, 2 if a word is loaded,
or 4 if a doubleword is loaded.

If the address-size attribute for this instruction is 16 bits, SI is used
for the source-index register; otherwise the address-size attribute is 32
bits, and the ESI register is used. The address of the source data is
determined solely by the contents of ESI/SI. Load the correct index value
into SI before executing the LODS instruction. LODSB, LODSW, LODSD are
synonyms for the byte, word, and doubleword LODS instructions.

LODS can be preceded by the REP prefix; however, LODS is used more typically
within a LOOP construct, because further processing of the data moved into
EAX, AX, or AL is usually necessary.

      IP  IP + SignExtend(rel8);
   ELSE (* OperandSize = 32 *)
      EIP  EIP + SignExtend(rel8);
   FI;
FI;

Description

LOOP decrements the count register without changing any of the flags.
Conditions are then checked for the form of LOOP being used. If the
conditions are met, a short jump is made to the label given by the operand
to LOOP. If the address-size attribute is 16 bits, the CX register is used
as the count register; otherwise the ECX register is used. The operand
of LOOP must be in the range from 128 (decimal) bytes before the
instruction to 127 bytes ahead of the instruction.

The LOOP instructions provide iteration control and combine loop index
management with conditional branching. Use the LOOP instruction by
loading an unsigned iteration count into the count register, then code the
LOOP at the end of a series of instructions to be iterated. The
destination of LOOP is a label that points to the beginning of the
iteration.

                                          selector r/m32 (page granular)


Description

The LSL instruction loads a register with an unscrambled segment limit,
and sets ZF to 1, provided that the source selector is visible at the CPL
weakened by RPL, and that the descriptor is a type accepted by LSL.
Otherwise, ZF is cleared to 0, and the destination register is unchanged.
The segment limit is loaded as a byte granular value. If the descriptor
has a page granular segment limit, LSL will translate it to a byte limit
before loading it in the destination register (shift left 12 the 20-bit
"raw" limit from descriptor, then OR with 00000FFFH).

The 32-bit forms of this instruction store the 32-bit byte granular limit
in the 16-bit destination register.

Code and data segment descriptors are valid for LSL.

The valid special segment and gate descriptor types for LSL are given
in the following table:

Type   Name                      Valid/Invalid

Operation

DEST  SRC;

Description

MOV copies the second operand to the first operand.

If the destination operand is a segment register (DS, ES, SS, etc.), then
data from a descriptor is also loaded into the register. The data for the
register is obtained from the descriptor table entry for the selector
given. A null selector (values 0000-0003) can be loaded into DS and ES
registers without causing an exception; however, use of DS or ES causes a
#GP(0), and no memory reference occurs.

A MOV into SS inhibits all interrupts until after the execution of the
next instruction (which is presumably a MOV into eSP).

Loading a segment register under 80386 Protected Mode results in special
checks and actions, as described in the following listing:

IF SS is loaded;
THEN
   IF selector is null THEN #GP(0);
FI;
   Selector index must be within its descriptor table limits else
      #GP(selector);
   Selector's RPL must equal CPL else #GP(selector);
AR byte must indicate a writable data segment else #GP(selector);
   DPL in the AR byte must equal CPL else #GP(selector);
   Segment must be marked present else #SS(selector);
   Load SS with selector;
   Load SS with descriptor.
FI;
IF DS, ES, FS or GS is loaded with non-null selector;
THEN
   Selector index must be within its descriptor table limits
      else #GP(selector);
   AR byte must indicate data or readable code segment else
      #GP(selector);
   IF data or nonconforming code segment
   THEN both the RPL and the CPL must be less than or equal to DPL in
      AR byte;
   ELSE #GP(selector);
   FI;
   Segment must be marked present else #NP(selector);
   Load segment register with selector;
   Load segment register with descriptor;
FI;
IF DS, ES, FS or GS is loaded with a null selector;
THEN

Description

MOVS copies the byte or word at [(E)SI] to the byte or word at
ES:[(E)DI]. The destination operand must be addressable from the ES
register; no segment override is possible for the destination. A segment
override can be used for the source operand; the default is DS.

The addresses of the source and destination are determined solely by the
contents of (E)SI and (E)DI. Load the correct index values into (E)SI
and (E)DI before executing the MOVS instruction. MOVSB, MOVSW,
and MOVSD are synonyms for the byte, word, and doubleword MOVS
instructions.

After the data is moved, both (E)SI and (E)DI are advanced
automatically. If the direction flag is 0 (CLD was executed), the registers
are incremented; if the direction flag is 1 (STD was executed), the
registers are decremented. The registers are incremented or decremented by 1
if a byte was moved, 2 if a word was moved, or 4 if a doubleword was moved.

MOVS can be preceded by the REP prefix for block movement of CX
bytes or words. Refer to the REP instruction for details of this operation.

NOTES:
  The 80386 uses an early-out multiply algorithm. The actual number of
  clocks depends on the position of the most significant bit in the 
  optimizing multiplier, shown underlined above. The optimization occurs
  for positive and negative multiplier values. Because of the early-out
  algorithm, clock counts given are minimum to maximum. To calculate the
  actual clocks, use the following formula:

    Actual clock = if  <> 0 then max(ceiling(log{2} ณmณ), 3) + 6 clocks;

    Actual clock = if  = 0 then 9 clocks

  where m is the multiplier.

     carry and overflow flags are set to 0 if AH is 0; otherwise, they are
     set to 1.

    A word operand is multiplied by AX; the result is left in DX:AX.
     DX contains the high-order 16 bits of the product. The carry and
     overflow flags are set to 0 if DX is 0; otherwise, they are set to 1.

    A doubleword operand is multiplied by EAX and the result is left in
     EDX:EAX. EDX contains the high-order 32 bits of the product. The
     carry and overflow flags are set to 0 if EDX is 0; otherwise, they are

Description

OUTS transfers data from the memory byte, word, or doubleword at the
source-index register to the output port addressed by the DX register. If
the address-size attribute for this instruction is 16 bits, SI is used for
the source-index register; otherwise, the address-size attribute is 32 bits,
and ESI is used for the source-index register.

OUTS does not allow specification of the port number as an immediate value.
The port must be addressed through the DX register value. Load the correct
value into DX before executing the OUTS instruction.

The address of the source data is determined by the contents of
source-index register. Load the correct index value into SI or ESI before
executing the OUTS instruction.

After the transfer, source-index register is advanced automatically. If
the direction flag is 0 (CLD was executed), the source-index register is
incremented; if the direction flag is 1 (STD was executed), it is
decremented. The amount of the increment or decrement is 1 if a byte is
output, 2 if a word is output, or 4 if a doubleword is output.

OUTSB, OUTSW, and OUTSD are synonyms for the byte, word, and
doubleword OUTS instructions. OUTS can be preceded by the REP
prefix for block output of CX bytes or words. Refer to the REP
instruction for details on this operation.

Description

POP replaces the previous contents of the memory, the register, or the
segment register operand with the word on the top of the 80386 stack,
addressed by SS:SP (address-size attribute of 16 bits) or SS:ESP
(addresssize attribute of 32 bits). The stack pointer SP is incremented
by 2 for an operand-size of 16 bits or by 4 for an operand-size of 32 bits.
It then points to the new top of stack.

POP CS is not an 80386 instruction. Popping from the stack into the CS
register is accomplished with a RET instruction.

If the destination operand is a segment register (DS, ES, FS, GS, or
SS), the value popped must be a selector. In protected mode, loading the
selector initiates automatic loading of the descriptor information
associated with that selector into the hidden part of the segment register;
loading also initiates validation of both the selector and the descriptor
information.

A null value (0000-0003) may be popped into the DS, ES, FS, or GS
register without causing a protection exception. An attempt to reference
a segment whose corresponding segment register is loaded with a null
value causes a #GP(0) exception. No memory reference occurs. The saved
value of the segment register is null.

A POP SS instruction inhibits all interrupts, including NMI, until after
execution of the next instruction. This allows sequential execution of POP
SS and POP eSP instructions without danger of having an invalid stack
during an interrupt. However, use of the LSS instruction is the preferred
method of loading the SS and eSP registers.

Loading a segment register while in protected mode results in special
checks and actions, as described in the following listing:

IF SS is loaded:
   IF selector is null THEN #GP(0);
   Selector index must be within its descriptor table limits ELSE
      #GP(selector);
   Selector's RPL must equal CPL ELSE #GP(selector);
   AR byte must indicate a writable data segment ELSE #GP(selector);
   DPL in the AR byte must equal CPL ELSE #GP(selector);
   Segment must be marked present ELSE #SS(selector);
   Load SS register with selector;
   Load SS register with descriptor;

IF DS, ES, FS or GS is loaded with non-null selector:
   AR byte must indicate data or readable code segment ELSE
      #GP(selector);
   IF data or nonconforming code
   THEN both the RPL and the CPL must be less than or equal to DPL in
      AR byte
   ELSE #GP(selector);
   FI;
   Segment must be marked present ELSE #NP(selector);
   Load segment register with selector;
   Load segment register with descriptor;

IF DS, ES, FS, or GS is loaded with a null selector:
   Load segment register with selector
   Clear valid bit in invisible portion of register

Operation

Flags  Pop();

Description

POPF/POPFD pops the word or doubleword on the top of the stack and
stores the value in the flags register. If the operand-size attribute of
the instruction is 16 bits, then a word is popped and the value is stored in
FLAGS. If the operand-size attribute is 32 bits, then a doubleword is popped
and the value is stored in EFLAGS.

Refer to Chapter 2 and Chapter 4 for information about the FLAGS
and EFLAGS registers. Note that bits 16 and 17 of EFLAGS, called
VM and RF, respectively, are not affected by POPF or POPFD.

The I/O privilege level is altered only when executing at privilege level
0. The interrupt flag is altered only when executing at a level at least as
privileged as the I/O privilege level. (Real-address mode is equivalent to
privilege level 0.) If a POPF instruction is executed with insufficient
privilege, an exception does not occur, but the privileged bits do not
change.

Description

PUSH decrements the stack pointer by 2 if the operand-size attribute of
the instruction is 16 bits; otherwise, it decrements the stack pointer by
4. PUSH then places the operand on the new top of stack, which is

before the instruction. This differs from the 8086, where PUSH SP
pushes the new value (decremented by 2).

Description

PUSHA and PUSHAD save the 16-bit or 32-bit general registers,
respectively, on the 80386 stack. PUSHA decrements the stack pointer
(SP) by 16 to hold the eight word values. PUSHAD decrements the
stack pointer (ESP) by 32 to hold the eight doubleword values. Because
the registers are pushed onto the stack in the order in which they were

Description

Each rotate instruction shifts the bits of the register or memory operand
given. The left rotate instructions shift all the bits upward, except for
the top bit, which is returned to the bottom. The right rotate instructions
do the reverse: the bits shift downward until the bottom bit arrives at
the top.

For the RCL and RCR instructions, the carry flag is part of the rotated
quantity. RCL shifts the carry flag into the bottom bit and shifts the top
bit into the carry flag; RCR shifts the carry flag into the top bit and
shifts the bottom bit into the carry flag. For the ROL and ROR
instructions, the original value of the carry flag is not a part of the
result, but the carry flag receives a copy of the bit that was shifted from
one end to the other.

The rotate is repeated the number of times indicated by the second
operand, which is either an immediate number or the contents of the CL
register. To reduce the maximum instruction execution time, the 80386
does not allow rotation counts greater than 31. If a rotation count greater
than 31 is attempted, only the bottom five bits of the rotation are used.
The 8086 does not mask rotation counts. The 80386 in Virtual 8086 Mode does
mask rotation counts.

The overflow flag is defined only for the single-rotate forms of the
instructions (second operand = 1). It is undefined in all other cases. For
left shifts/rotates, the CF bit after the shift is XORed with the
high-order result bit. For right shifts/rotates, the high-order two bits of
the result are XORed to get OF.

Flags Affected

OF only for single rotates; OF is undefined for multi-bit rotates; CF as
described above

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if the result is in a nonwritable segment; #GP(0) for an illegal
memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS
segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code)
for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault

Description

REP, REPE (repeat while equal), and REPNE (repeat while not equal)
are prefix that are applied to string operation. Each prefix cause the
string instruction that follows to be repeated the number of times
indicated in the count register or (for REPE and REPNE) until the
indicated condition in the zero flag is no longer met.

Synonymous forms of REPE and REPNE are REPZ and REPNZ,
respectively.

The REP prefixes apply only to one string instruction at a time. To repeat
a block of instructions, use the LOOP instruction or another looping
construct.

The precise action for each iteration is as follows:

  1.  If the address-size attribute is 16 bits, use CX for the count
      register; if the address-size attribute is 32 bits, use ECX for the
      count register.

  2.  Check CX. If it is zero, exit the iteration, and move to the next
      instruction.

  3.  Acknowledge any pending interrupts.

  4.  Perform the string operation once.

  5.  Decrement CX or ECX by one; no flags are modified.

  6.  Check the zero flag if the string operation is SCAS or CMPS. If
      the repeat condition does not hold, exit the iteration and move to
      the next instruction. Exit the iteration if the prefix is REPE and ZF
      is 0 (the last comparison was not equal), or if the prefix is REPNE
      and ZF is one (the last comparison was equal).

  7.  Return to step 1 for the next iteration.

Repeated CMPS and SCAS instructions can be exited if the count is
exhausted or if the zero flag fails the repeat condition. These two cases
can be distinguished by using either the JCXZ instruction, or by using
the conditional jumps that test the zero flag (JZ, JNZ, and JNE).

Flags Affected

ZF by REP CMPS and REP SCAS as described above

Protected Mode Exceptions

#UD if a repeat prefix is used before an instruction that is not in the
list above; further exceptions can be generated when the string operation is
executed; refer to the descriptions of the string instructions themselves

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 6 if a repeat prefix is used before an instruction that is not in
the list above; further exceptions can be generated when the string
operation is executed; refer to the descriptions of the string instructions
themselves

Description

RET transfers control to a return address located on the stack. The
address is usually placed on the stack by a CALL instruction, and the
return is made to the instruction that follows the CALL.

The optional numeric parameter to RET gives the number of stack bytes
(OperandMode=16) or words (OperandMode=32) to be released after the return
address is popped. These items are typically used as input parameters to the
procedure called.

For the intrasegment (near) return, the address on the stack is a segment
offset, which is popped into the instruction pointer. The CS register is
unchanged. For the intersegment (far) return, the address on the stack
is a long pointer. The offset is popped first, followed by the selector.

In real mode, CS and IP are loaded directly. In Protected Mode, an
intersegment return causes the processor to check the descriptor
addressed by the return selector. The AR byte of the descriptor must
indicate a code segment of equal or lesser privilege (or greater or equal
numeric value) than the current privilege level. Returns to a lesser
privilege level cause the stack to be reloaded from the value saved beyond
the parameter block.

The DS, ES, FS, and GS segment registers can be set to 0 by the RET
instruction during an interlevel transfer. If these registers refer to
segments that cannot be used by the new privilege level, they are set to
0 to prevent unauthorized access from the new privilege level.

Description

SAL (or its synonym, SHL) shifts the bits of the operand upward. The
high-order bit is shifted into the carry flag, and the low-order bit is set
to 0.

SAR and SHR shift the bits of the operand downward. The low-order
bit is shifted into the carry flag. The effect is to divide the operand by
2. SAR performs a signed divide with rounding toward negative infinity (not
the same as IDIV); the high-order bit remains the same. SHR performs an
unsigned divide; the high-order bit is set to 0.

The shift is repeated the number of times indicated by the second
operand, which is either an immediate number or the contents of the CL
register. To reduce the maximum execution time, the 80386 does not
allow shift counts greater than 31. If a shift count greater than 31 is
attempted, only the bottom five bits of the shift count are used. (The
8086 uses all eight bits of the shift count.)

The overflow flag is set only if the single-shift forms of the instructions
are used. For left shifts, OF is set to 0 if the high bit of the answer is
the same as the result of the carry flag (i.e., the top two bits of the
original operand were the same); OF is set to 1 if they are different. For
SAR, OF is set to 0 for all single shifts. For SHR, OF is set to the
high-order bit of the original operand.

Flags Affected

OF for single shifts; OF is undefined for multiple shifts; CF, ZF, PF,
and SF as described in Appendix C

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if the result is in a nonwritable segment; #GP(0) for an illegal

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Description

SCAS subtracts the memory byte or word at the destination register from
the AL, AX or EAX register. The result is discarded; only the flags are set.
The operand must be addressable from the ES segment; no segment override is
possible.

If the address-size attribute for this instruction is 16 bits, DI is used
as the destination register; otherwise, the address-size attribute is 32
bits and EDI is used.

The address of the memory data being compared is determined solely by the
contents of the destination register, not by the operand to SCAS. The
operand validates ES segment addressability and determines the data type.
Load the correct index value into DI or EDI before executing SCAS.

After the comparison is made, the destination register is automatically
updated. If the direction flag is 0 (CLD was executed), the destination
register is incremented; if the direction flag is 1 (STD was executed), it
is decremented. The increments or decrements are by 1 if bytes are compared,
by 2 if words are compared, or by 4 if doublewords are compared.

SCASB, SCASW, and SCASD are synonyms for the byte, word and
doubleword SCAS instructions that don't require operands. They are
simpler to code, but provide no type or segment checking.

SCAS can be preceded by the REPE or REPNE prefix for a block search
of CX or ECX bytes or words. Refer to the REP instruction for further
details.

Flags Affected

The 16-bit forms of the SGDT/SIDT instructions are compatible with
the 80286, if the value in the upper eight bits is not referenced. The
80286 stores 1's in these upper bits, whereas the 80386 stores 0's if the
operand-size attribute is 16 bits. These bits were specified as undefined
by the SGDT/SIDT instructions in the iAPX 286 Programmer's
Reference Manual.

The count operand is provided by either an immediate byte or the contents
of the CL register. These operands are taken MODULO 32 to provide a number
between 0 and 31 by which to shift. Because the bits to shift are provided
by the specified registers, the operation is useful for multiprecision
shifts (64 bits or more). The SF, ZF and PF flags are set according to the
value of the result. CS is set to the value of the last bit shifted out. OF

Description

STOS transfers the contents of all AL, AX, or EAX register to the memory
byte or word given by the destination register relative to the ES segment.
The destination register is DI for an address-size attribute of 16 bits or
EDI for an address-size attribute of 32 bits.

The destination operand must be addressable from the ES register. A segment
override is not possible.

The address of the destination is determined by the contents of the
destination register, not by the explicit operand of STOS. This operand is
used only to validate ES segment addressability and to determine the data
type. Load the correct index value into the destination register before
executing STOS.

After the transfer is made, DI is automatically updated. If the direction
flag is 0 (CLD was executed), DI is incremented; if the direction flag is
1 (STD was executed), DI is decremented. DI is incremented or decremented by
1 if a byte is stored, by 2 if a word is stored, or by 4 if a doubleword is
stored.

STOSB, STOSW, and STOSD are synonyms for the byte, word, and doubleword STOS
instructions, that do not require an operand. They are simpler to use, but
provide no type or segment checking.

STOS can be preceded by the REP prefix for a block fill of CX or ECX bytes,
words, or doublewords. Refer to the REP instruction for further details.

Description

SUB subtracts the second operand (SRC) from the first operand (DEST). The
first operand is assigned the result of the subtraction, and the flags are
set accordingly.

When an immediate byte value is subtracted from a word operand, the
immediate value is first sign-extended to the size of the destination
operand.

VERR, VERW ฤฤ Verify a Segment for Reading or Writing

Opcode       Instruction   Clocks      Description

0F  00 /4    VERR r/m16    pm=10/11    Set ZF=1 if segment can be read,
                                       selector in r/m16
0F  00 /5    VERW r/m16    pm=15/16    Set ZF=1 if segment can be written,
                                       selector in r/m16


Operation

IF segment with selector at (r/m) is accessible
   with current protection level
   AND ((segment is readable for VERR) OR
      (segment is writable for VERW))
THEN ZF  0;
ELSE ZF  1;
FI;

Description

The two-byte register or memory operand of VERR and VERW contains
the value of a selector. VERR and VERW determine whether the
segment denoted by the selector is reachable from the current privilege
level and whether the segment is readable (VERR) or writable (VERW).
If the segment is accessible, the zero flag is set to 1; if the segment is
not accessible, the zero flag is set to 0. To set ZF, the following
conditions must be met:

    The selector must denote a descriptor within the bounds of the table
     (GDT or LDT); the selector must be "defined."

    The selector must denote the descriptor of a code or data segment
     (not that of a task state segment, LDT, or a gate).

    For VERR, the segment must be readable. For VERW, the segment
     must be a writable data segment.

    If the code segment is readable and conforming, the descriptor
     privilege level (DPL) can be any value for VERR. Otherwise, the
     DPL must be greater than or equal to (have less or the same
     privilege as) both the current privilege level and the selector's RPL.

The validation performed is the same as if the segment were loaded into
DS, ES, FS, or GS, and the indicated access (read or write) were
performed. The zero flag receives the result of the validation. The
selector's value cannot result in a protection exception, enabling the
software to anticipate possible segment access problems.

Flags Affected

ZF as described above

Protected Mode Exceptions

Faults generated by illegal addressing of the memory operand that
contains the selector, the selector is not loaded into any segment
register, and no faults attributable to the selector operand are generated

XLAT/XLATB ฤฤ Table Look-up Translation

D7    XLATB      5     Set AL to memory byte DS:[(E)BX + unsigned AL]


Operation

IF AddressSize = 16
THEN
   AL  (BX + ZeroExtend(AL))
ELSE (* AddressSize = 32 *)
   AL  (EBX + ZeroExtend(AL));
FI;

Description

XLAT changes the AL register from the table index to the table entry. AL
should be the unsigned index into a table addressed by DS:BX (for an
address-size attribute of 16 bits) or DS:EBX (for an address-size attribute
of 32 bits).

The operand to XLAT allows for the possibility of a segment override. XLAT
uses the contents of BX even if they differ from the offset of the operand.
The offset of the operand should have been moved intoBX/EBX with a previous
instruction.

The no-operand form, XLATB, can be used if the BX/EBX table will always
reside in the DS segment.

Flags Affected

None
